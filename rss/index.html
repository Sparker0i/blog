From seeing multiple bull-runs, to governments trying to destroy the movement of sovereign independence, &#xA0;to countries adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender, cryptocurrencies have come a long way. I have been holding crypto-currencies since 2019, but it was only at the start of this year that I actually started trading and buying them.</p><p>Now, if you ask anyone online about which crypto to buy, you will be frequently met with the term #DYOR - Do Your Own Research. Same was with me as well, whenever I&apos;ve asked people on tips, I was told to #DYOR, but there were not many tips online about what to do in DYOR. Like many in the beginning, I&apos;ve had my shares of success and failures in crypto hodling and trading. Here are a few tips I follow when looking to buy tokens.</p><h2 id="initial-research-and-filtering-bad-assets">Initial Research and Filtering Bad Assets</h2><p>Before I hodl or trade any tokens, I make sure to do some initial research with a few pointers. I&apos;d feel great about those tokens that meet this initial criteria, while others become a big no-go for the rest of my life (unless something drastically changes in that particular crypto&apos;s tech, but would be unlikely).</p><p>The first thing I do is visit CoinMarketCap website, search for the particular crypto I&apos;m looking to hodl or invest. Every major crypto asset listed on CoinMarketCap will have its own website, and that is the first thing I always look at. Within the website, the first thing you should read is the <strong>Whitepaper</strong> of the token. When you read through the various pages on a particular crypto&apos;s website, I am able to mostly detect any non-sense or BS. If it uses any terms or protocols that you find it hard to comprehend - like it &quot;<strong>promises</strong>&quot; a huge payout or claims to have some tech that seems to good to be true (like self-mining) - immediately avoid it. </p><p>You should also look for some more things like Roadmap of features for the particular project and the track record on how it has delivered so far on all those features. If a project has consistently failed or lagged behind to deliver new features, you should treat it as another yellow flag. I&apos;d also look at how the crypto&apos;s tech functions and the value a token is trying to create. If there are no unique use-cases or if the crypto does not require/benefit from the use of blockchain fundamentals, I&apos;d give it a red flag and move on.</p><p>Another thing that you should really look at is the Blockchain Explorer for a given crypto. First thing I&apos;d check here is the max supply for the given crypto. Needless to say, stablecoins are a no-go here. If there&apos;s no max supply for a token, it is usually a Red Flag from my side, although there are a very few exceptions for this - like Ethereum. If you still want to go ahead and deal with cryptos without a max supply, you should do it at your own risk and must usually look to own it only for the short-term and not hodl them.</p><p>Next thing you should look at is the distribution of tokens across all wallet holders of the given token. If you see that one wallet holds more than 15-20% of the total current supply, I&apos;d raise a red flag here. The moment a big whale dumps (sells) all those coins, the entire crypto will start reeling. Best example would be Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/ethereum-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-destroys-410-trillion-shiba-inu-coins/VCNH2FDFQYRVDD6U3Q6VFYZ2XQ/">dumping 45% of the entire Shiba Inu coins in supply</a>, causing a massive drop in the price of the Shiba Inu coin. (More surprising in the case of Shiba Inu is that the Whitepaper of the coin still refers Buterin as a visionary - &quot;like its anonymous founder&quot; - even after he dumped the project&apos;s worth)</p><p>Some other pointers that you can consider to research would be browsing the source code of a given asset on GitHub and the amount of activity in its repos in the recent past. As an alternate means, try going through the blogs and subreddit of the given token and look for any threads that look skeptical to you.</p><h2 id="avoid-scams">Avoid Scams</h2><p>When you start off dealing with cryptos, you would be looking at ways to maximize money instantly. While I&apos;d say it is not impossible, but I would advise you to not do that. Lured by the opportunity of making quick money, people might fall into the trap of crypto scams.</p><p>Most of these scams happen on Telegram within groups which usually advertise quick money making schemes in the form of Token Airdrops. They will mostly look to lure you with &quot;verified&quot; token deposit screenshots from customers. These &quot;customers&quot; are either running the scam along with the admins of the group, or are accounts managed by the admins themselves. If you look to participate in such airdrops, you will end up losing all your life savings.</p><p>However, I&apos;m not saying all airdrops are bad. Some of them that have happened - like the Stellar Airdrops in 2017 and 2019. But that was done by a verified entity - the Stellar Foundation. Here we are talking about Telegram groups that are run by Anonymous Users. Such groups are always Bait and Scam, and I would recommend you to avoid them.</p><h2 id="fill-out-an-investment-checklist">Fill out an Investment Checklist</h2><p>Once I&apos;m done filtering out the coins I invest in, I look to create an investment checklist where I have noted certain questions that I ask before I invest in a coin. Here are the details of the questions:</p><ul><li><strong>What is the problem that a crypto is trying to solve? </strong>Like I mentioned in the previous section, if a token does not serve a purpose or does not solve a problem - not just with blockchains or the financial sector, but any sector, say Education or Supply Chain - I believe there is no reason for that coin to exist. Such coins are only hype driven and only good for short-term trading. I will call such hype-driven coins as <strong>Shitcoins</strong> from now. Hodling them for a long term will leave you reeling.</li><li><strong>What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?</strong> I will look for is the history of some of the Lead members on a project and see what they have worked on previously - via information they post online (say on LinkedIn). If they are anonymous members (exception: Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin), I&apos;ll automatically raise a Red flag on that crypto and move on. Then, I will also look at how they are funded. Whether they have partnerships with Enterprises or they have solved a critical problem for any pillar of the society - say government or law - or any other major piece of news regarding any advancement that was made possible because of a crypto.</li><li><strong>Who is their competition and how big is the market they&apos;re targeting?</strong> What is the roadmap they created? Like I&apos;ve mentioned in the previous section, you should always have a look at the roadmap for a given token. No roadmap -&gt; No progress -&gt; Red Flag. Also you need to look at the other coins being offered in the market and how do they compete with the token you&apos;re looking to buy. Because healthy competition always leads to success, unless you&apos;re looking for a shitcoin, or the competitors of a given token are all shitcoins.</li><li><strong>Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?</strong> There are cryptos which rely on various types of consensus mechanisms - Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Time and Space etc.</li><li><strong>How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder?</strong></li><li><strong>What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?</strong> Of course there can never be some shortcoming associated with a given crypto. If there are none, it sounds too good to be true. (Even for Bitcoin, there&apos;s only one disadvantage that I can think about - Electricity consumption. But that too is definitely lesser than electricity used for mining actual Gold, or by the entire banking system around the world)</li></ul><h2 id="create-a-valuation-framework-for-a-token">Create a Valuation Framework for a token</h2><p>With the boom that crypto trading has seen since November 2020, you must always be sure of what coins you want to invest in. I&apos;ve been a part of various crypto groups on multiple sites like Facebook and Reddit. In it, I&apos;ve seen a lot of people complain about the losses they&apos;ve had to made while dealing with crypto, because they either bought high and then the market went bearish, or they invested in the pump-and-dump shitcoins. </p><p>To avoid becoming one among such people, you need to have a certain valuation model for a given crypto. Even if you create a basic one, you&apos;ll go miles ahead of your peers/other people. Here are some simple things you can consider doing:</p><ul><li>Look at the total market cap of the coin and compare it with the size of the market it is trying to address. Market cap here includes not only the circulating supply, but also the max supply possible for the crypto.</li><li>Check for the total number of users of a given token. I believe that the value of a given crypto would be proportional to the number of users using the crypto. The best known crypto out there is Bitcoin and there are almost 100 Million people already using it. Compounded with its scarcity, its scale and community is why Bitcoin carries a huge value.</li></ul><p>These were 2 very basic checks that I do for any crypto. I might add some other checks in the evaluation framework as well. Once you have a model setup, you can then evaluate one crypto against another, and also see why you would want to own this coin rather than do short-term trading. Doing this will lead you to think long term about dealing with a given crypto and think more about the &quot;value&quot; it provides. </p><p>Once you do this, you will have more mental peace and have good confidence for your decision making. You would also not panic when there are any short-term price dips.</p><h2 id="portfolio-allocation">Portfolio Allocation</h2><p>This is one of the crucial aspects of your journey with crypto. You should think on how much fiat you can use to buy crypto, as well as how do you want to allocate your crypto portfolio between &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;rigged&quot; cryptos. (planned pump-and-dump, shitcoins etc.). If you&apos;re just starting out, I would recommend you to not go with shitcoins to begin with. I have seen a few of my friends who started their crypto journeys because of celebrities who rig coins like Elon Musk and co. The peak of this came during Elon&apos;s SNL appearance. Despite my advice against it, most of my friends bought Dogecoin only because of Elon&apos;s appearance and thinking it&apos;s price will keep going up if they bought then. Little did they know that it was the starting point for dumping Dogecoin, whose effects can still be felt today. Many of my friends felt cheated, and some of them have left the crypto space despite my assurances that not all cryptos are bad.</p><p>So if you&apos;re just starting out, I&apos;d recommend having 80-90% of your portfolio filled with safe coins. Once you become more informed and confident, you can start dealing with Shitcoins and vary your portfolio allocation. You should also think in terms of crypto categories as well as the percentage of your portfolio in each of these segments. For starters, I categorise crypto into following categories: (You may disagree with how I&apos;m grouping the cryptos, but we can agree to disagree)</p><ul><li>Core Holdings: Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC)</li><li>Smart Contracts: Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), ALGO, Solana etc.</li><li>Crypto with Privacy?: Monero (XMR), ZCash</li><li>Intermediary with fiat dealings/Bank Settlement: Stellar (XLM), Ripple (XRP)</li><li>Enterprise Solutions: VeChain etc.</li><li>Promising: NANO, IOTA, RVN, Algo etc.</li><li>Coins without intrinsic value (Shitcoin): DOGE + the army of dog coins (Shiba, Kishu) etc.</li></ul><p>You should also have a fair idea about the market conditions as there is a lot of uncertainty today, mostly due to policies+governments and others due to rigging shitcoins. Due to this uncertainty, you should best stick to the core holdings and then pick up coins in segments you are knowledgeable enough about. Example, if you don&apos;t know about Smart Contracts, how can you be sure that ALGO is a game changer?</p><p>This is where portfolio diversification and allocation comes into place. You should look to diversify, but in the ever-changing world of crypto you shouldn&apos;t look to diversify way too much. It would be difficult for you to keep up with all the changes that have occurred across cryptos. I wouldn&apos;t recommend you to have more than 10-12 cryptos. If you have more, I would recommend you to consolidate to the few segments you are well knowledgeable about.</p><h2 id="learn-everyday">Learn Everyday</h2><p>If you aren&apos;t doing this already, read a bit daily on cryptocurrencies. There are decent YouTubers that talk about the market movements in the crypto space. You should also learn more about the underlying principles in the crypto space. More specifically, if you are not aware of basics like Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Space (PoS), learn about it first.</p><p>If you invest in stocks, one factor you would look for is what are the core offerings of a given company and how it performs against other peers. If you don&apos;t know about how the underlying technology of a crypto works, learn about it as well. That will increase your belief if you want to buy that crypto. If you don&apos;t care about the underlying technology or find reading about it very tedious, I believe you shouldn&apos;t be in this crypto space at all and shouldn&apos;t look to invest here, otherwise you will feel betrayed after your coins&apos; value gets dumped.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is the state of targeted digital advertising broken?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Advertisements are everywhere - newspapers, TV channels, billboards, and digital.

It&apos;s failing the users and the advertisers themselves. Internet advertising majorly uses targeted/personalized ads to go after you and cater products you would most likely want. This ends up collecting as much data about you as it can.</p><p>In this blog post, I will argue why the current model of internet advertising is bad, and how can you save yourself from being a victim of personalized ad targeting.</p><h2 id="a-regular-user-s-perspective-on-advertising">A Regular User&apos;s Perspective on Advertising</h2><p>If you ask me what are the problems with the current model of advertising online, here are a few things I might suggest:</p><ul><li>Ads violate privacy: There&apos;s no secret to this, internet advertising scoops up as much information about you from the services you visit and use.</li><li>Ads are disruptive: As an example, sometimes you click on a blank area in a website, you then see a new pop-up window with an ad, despite your browser blocking pop-ups</li><li>Ads are annoying: Sometimes you visit an interesting website, and the very next moment when you open a social media website, you start seeing ads about this almost everytime.</li><li>Malicious Ads: A vast majority of the people of my generation shouldn&apos;t be worried about Malicious ads, as our generation is aware about websites and malware, and we&apos;d only visit website after due diligence. But our previous generations are not so well-informed about websites, they would click on any website and that site may end up spreading malware.</li></ul><p>What I&apos;m worried about is the first point - Digital Advertising violating our privacy. While our previous generations are not much aware about their Data Privacy, our current generation does worry about it.</p><p>While we sit here, worrying about our privacy, IMF has &quot;suggested&quot; that a person&apos;s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/your-credit-score-should-be-based-on-your-web-history-1845912592">credit history should be based on their Web History</a>. That&apos;s how ridiculous things may get in the future if things are not corrected today. A 2018 study by researchers at Data and Society <a href="https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DS_Digital_Influence_Machine.pdf">concluded </a>that &#x201C;today&#x2019;s digital advertising infrastructure creates disturbing new opportunities for political manipulation and other forms of antidemocratic strategic communication.&#x201D;</p><p>Even without concerns of privacy violations, there have been many efforts to try and fix some of the issues:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.betterads.org/">Coalition for Better Ads</a></li><li><a href="https://acceptableads.com/">Acceptable Ads</a></li><li>Brave</li></ul><p>These only fix some of the problems with Advertising in general, not the entire problem. </p><h2 id="attention-economy">Attention Economy</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/digital-billboards.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Is the state of targeted digital advertising broken?" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Multiple advertisements craving for your attention</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://medium.com/rsa-journal/democracy-distracted-cf3272ceb3c4">Herbert Simon argued in the 70s </a>that when information becomes abundant, attention becomes the scarce resource. In today&apos;s modern age, we&#x2019;re living through the pendulum swing of that reversal&#x2014;yet we consistently overlook its implications. </p><p>When you visit any website or browse through any app, you take some time out of your life - or your <strong>attention</strong> to visit that resource. You are also using some of your attention to read this post (for which I&apos;m eternally grateful). Now, you normally wouldn&apos;t take out some of this attention to visit a website that you haven&apos;t clicked by yourself. Thus, such websites/apps allow to advertise within itself (mostly as a small banner) via publishers, so that you don&apos;t have to take out extra time off your life just to visit the standalone ad. Then, such publishers use your &quot;actions&quot;, and use such individualized data about you - collected via algorithms - and sell slots to advertisers to display ads.</p><p>Wikipedia has a perfect definition for this - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">Attention Economy</a>.</p><p>Who wouldn&apos;t love to have an individualized feed of news. Sadly, individualization that happens today is neither for our own benefit nor for getting a peace of mind. Rather such a system only invites more outrage from us - users.</p><p>Now, an incentive driven advertising system is good for the publishers, who earn good money; and advertisers, who get to sell lot more of their products. But this is bad for the user. There are literally billions of dollars being spent to figure out how to persuade you to look at a certain thing over a competitor&apos;s; to care about one thing over another. This is the way most of the information in this world is being monetized today.</p><p>We can all see the effects of Attention Economy - Social Media websites like Twitter and Facebook never want people of different groups to stop fighting - be it over religion, sports or their political bias. This is because these networks are optimized in a way to promote fighting, or spread fake news/propaganda very quickly. You may argue that companies are investing to stop fake news, but I believe that it is still relatively minor as they don&apos;t really want their revenue streams to go down.</p><h2 id="my-take-on-digital-ads">My take on digital ads</h2><p>I don&#x2019;t want any relevant ads, or any ad-driven products, ever. Other people might feel differently, but collecting the data is only half the problem. That data can be abused, even if only client-side - for example targeting could exploit you and persuade to buy stuff you don&#x2019;t need. The whole point of ads is to change your behavior, if only slightly, with advertisers literally bidding for your attention, and then playing mind tricks, which work because of how our critical thinking often fails us a majority of the times.</p><p>I believe great products have often been successful via word of mouth referrals. A great example would be <strong>Cred</strong>. Only a few credit card users in India were aware of the Cred before September 2020. That month, a delayed IPL 2020 started, and Cred ads - which a majority of the Indians never understood - was everywhere on TV, getting people&apos;s interest in knowing about the product, and eventually end up using it. There are tactics that don&#x2019;t involve tricking people into changing their behavior. Conventional advertising is better than the targeted ones, because it&#x2019;s not individualized. At least everybody else is seeing the same shit that you&#x2019;re seeing.</p><p>That brings us to the most important question - What should companies do? Honestly speaking, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s our problem. I don&apos;t think any company should be entitled to our data or our attention. When was the last time you ever saw an ad that made you feel this is the real deal. I haven&apos;t, have you?</p><p>You know how the unethical behavior of companies is always excused via the requirement of company stakeholders to make money? Well, this goes both ways. We, the consumers, aren&#x2019;t running any charity. I strongly feel it isn&#x2019;t our job to save such dying business models.</p><h3 id="first-party-ads">First Party Ads</h3><p>One solution to the problem could be the content providers (websites/apps) serving ads based on content that is being viewed right now. This might ensure there is no need to keep user&apos;s profile and history. Your data will no longer be shared to third-parties and hence the quality of ads shown will get better - which also means no scam ads and no malvertising.</p><p>This too has a problem. Even if there is a whitelist for &#x201C;acceptable ads&#x201D;, the problem is those ads are still downloaded Javascript code, with no way to review what they do. Further, third-party requests could get disguised as first-party ones. In such cases, you have to trust the publishers, which I&apos;d usually find a hard time to do.</p><h3 id="then-wouldn-t-ad-blocking-affect-the-internet">Then, Wouldn&apos;t Ad-Blocking affect the Internet?</h3><p>Given a choice between receiving ads, and no ads, sane people would obviously choose no ads. Nobody likes ads. If its forced, we have to gulp it down our throat, because either there&apos;s no clear alternative (Facebook), or the price of no-ads option is way too high (Youtube, Spotify, Apple Music, Hotstar et al.).</p><p>Almost no browser ships with an aggressive ad-blocker enabled by default. This is because somewhere or the other, their business model is also dependent on ads, even if they don&apos;t serve ads directly. It will only make the end user&apos;s experience much better. Many browsers that claim to do aggressive ad-blocking like Microsoft Edge, Brave, Samsung, Vivaldi et al. earn a lot of money from advertising.</p><p>Now, wouldn&apos;t ad-blocking affect the Internet&apos;s health? Yes, it will. Negatively, on the advertisers and publishers&apos; wallets; Positively on the rest of the internet, because it can only get better from there on.</p><h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2><h2 id="pay-for-the-things-you-use">Pay for the things you use</h2><p>A wise man once said,</p><blockquote>&quot;If you are not paying for a product, <strong>you are the product</strong>&quot;.</blockquote><p>If I really enjoy something, I don&apos;t mind paying for it. For example, I&apos;ve been using <strong>Hey email</strong> since July. It did not catch my attention because of all the amazing features it brings, but rather because of its infamous <a href="https://hey.com/apple/">feud with Apple</a>. In short, Hey is a radical re-thinking of what an Email client should be. As one Twitter user puts it:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In positive news, <a href="https://t.co/lwKSOQNcFe">https://t.co/lwKSOQNcFe</a> seems to have finally solved email (!!!). Been using it several weeks and no longer dealing with spam, long lists of &#x201C;unread&#x201D; messages, or sorting out annoying but important docs. The relief is so real &#x1F64C;&#x1F3FC;</p>&#x2014; Dr. Darya Rose &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8; (@summertomato) <a href="https://twitter.com/summertomato/status/1270816132102930433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</figure><p>I&apos;ve been using it so far without any major problems. All advertising mails are now screened out, so that they never take my attention again. I&apos;ve changed emails for all my online accounts to reflect to my hey.com email address. Now there are certain services like stock and mutual fund brokers, whose email change process has to be offline. Once all of my services are moved over to Hey, I&apos;m deleting all my non Hey mail accounts (except primary Google Play Store and Microsoft Store accounts, because all my app/in-app purchase history is sitting in those 2 accounts).</p><p>Similarly, I&apos;m also using <strong>Spotify Premium</strong> because I don&apos;t want myself to be exposed to their ads right after one song.</p><p>I also pay for <strong>Xbox Game Pass for PC</strong>. It has more than 100 AAA PC games that I can easily play on my Lenovo Legion Y740 laptop. There are no ads in the games that are played via XGP. I regularly play Age of Empires 2: DE, Flight Simulator, Doom Eternal, Moto GP20 and The Outer Worlds. Buying all those games individually would&apos;ve cost me a fortune, but at Rs 489/month (577 if you include taxes) it is a killer deal, specially for gamers like me. I am also using <strong>Kindle Unlimited</strong> for Reading as many Books as I can.</p><p>With all the information I&apos;m unearthing every single day about the shady practices of all developers, I&apos;m removing all ads-enabled apps from my mobiles. Moreover, if I find that any app is sharing data that is unwanted, I promptly uninstall that app. If at all I really need to use the app&apos;s services which provide ads, I would find a browser-based alternative for it - Eg. Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, IG, Amazon + Entertainment apps.</p><h2 id="block-all-ads">Block All Ads</h2><p>Even if you may think that some ads are fine, but do you know whether those are targeted specifically to you or not? Even if there&apos;s a whitelist of &quot;acceptable ads&quot;, it&apos;s still Javascript code downloaded from the internet, which I have no idea about its functionality. It&apos;s still intrusive, and drives you to buy things you don&apos;t really want.</p><p>I really think it is wrong that Publishers think they can run code on our devices. If publishers think otherwise, they can feel free to block me from using their services. If I see any website that serves me ads (and gets caught by my ad blockers), I&apos;d really start looking for alternatives.</p><h3 id="blocking-for-all-devices">Blocking for all devices</h3><p>DNS blocking has worked well so far. That is until apps/sites starting using DNS-over-HTTPS over their own servers. Still there are techniques to circumvent this too.</p><p><strong><u>PiHole</u></strong>: I had a Raspberry Pi 3B sitting idle at home for the last 1 year or so. When I got to know that I could run a service like Pihole on it, I wasted no time to set it up. Ever since Christmas eve, I&apos;ve been using Pihole to block ads for all the devices my family uses. And the stats are great too:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Is the state of targeted digital advertising broken?" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Pihole stats since December 23, 2020</figcaption></figure><p>Though the only downside to this is that I&apos;ve had to change my router to use static IP address assignment. There was some initial hassle in setting up my router and the devices, but once that was done, ads were a thing of the past (except Youtube ads, for which there is no working solution in 2021. Screw you, Google).</p><p><strong><u>Hosted services</u></strong>: 3 months before trying out Pihole, I tried using NextDNS. While the results were incredible, I felt that giving away Rs. 159 every month (187 including taxes) was a bit too much for me. I&apos;ve also heard about Adguard DNS, but I haven&apos;t used it so far.</p><h2 id="individual-devices">Individual Devices</h2><h3 id="desktop-laptop-android-devices">Desktop/Laptop + Android devices</h3><p>Even before I&apos;ve been using PiHole, I had experimented with ad blocking via browser extensions. The best combination I&apos;ve found is Firefox + uBlock Origin + Privacy Badger. It simply works.</p><p>uBlock Origin is by far the best ad blocker I&apos;ve ever used. Ever since installing it, I&apos;ve noticed far better loading speeds, because there are lesser resources to be loaded. It also protects against CNAME cloaking, where 3rd party requests masquerade as 1st party ones and you might not even notice it.</p><p>Sadly, this won&apos;t work with Google Chrome and other Chromium forked browsers in the near future. This is because Manifest v3 for Chrome extensions will be deployed in Google Chrome sometime in January (with the release of v88). Simply put, Manifest is something any extension developer will have to follow while developing an extension. This particular Manifest v3 changes the way ad-blocking extensions function. This negatively impacts ad-blockers and uBlock is one of them.</p><p>My take on this will be to ditch Chrome/Chromium forked browsers ASAP. Switch to Firefox while you still can, because Mozilla&apos;s financials aren&apos;t great, and the browser could go kaput anytime.</p><p>The same combination also works well for Android as well, just that you will have to update the Firefox browser to whichever latest version is available.</p><h3 id="what-about-brave-browser">What about Brave Browser?</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Is the state of targeted digital advertising broken?" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Brave browser displaying ads from Brave Network via OS notifications</figcaption></figure><p>Brave is yet another Chromium fork which focuses on user privacy by blocking trackers, scripts and ads by default. So inside some pages where ads don&apos;t load properly, you might be forced to turn down Brave Shields, which will then open up the website to show you ads.</p><p>By the time you&apos;ve reached here, you must&apos;ve realised that internet is up and running, all thanks to advertisements. The content you might be seeing for free is able to remain free because of advertising. This is profitable for both advertisers and publishers, but not the users.</p><p>Brave attempts to change the advertising model by flipping the pyramid upside down. What I mean is, users get paid for getting advertisements on their devices. It allows users to opt-in to its own Brave rewards system (in other words, another advertising system). Brave serves ads after blocking ads from third party providers on websites, and then start showing ads from their own advertising platform via OS level notifications.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve opted-in, Brave will display you &apos;privacy-respecting&apos; ads (it&apos;s still an advertisement btw &#x1F602;) &#xA0;and if you receive an ad, you will be rewarded with a BAT cryptocurrency (BAT = Basic Attention Token), which you can use to support Brave verified creators (You can&apos;t withdraw those tokens to your crypto wallet yet, that&apos;s coming soon though). </p><p>Brave intends to serve ads as per user interests, in an anonymised way. This could be either via client-side profiling, or simply piggybacking what a user is currently viewing. While rewards and ads maybe opt-in for users, they are not for publishers, leaving us in a very awkward position. If a publisher wants a cut of the rewards, they need to be a part of the Brave Partner program.</p><p>With this behaviour, I feel that Brave is yet another middleman between the user and the advertiser. Other companies also have the same model of running their business. You are trusting an advertising company (Brave) - just like Google - to preserve your privacy. What an irony.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>I want the targeted advertisement system to die. I will go to all lengths to block all ads. I feel companies are not entitled to my data or my time (&apos;attention&apos;).</p><p><u>Read More:</u></p><ul><li><a href="https://practicaltypography.com/the-cowardice-of-brave.html">The cowardice of Brave</a></li><li><a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19744680W/Ten_arguments_for_deleting_your_social_media_accounts_right_now">Ten arguments for deleting your Social Media account right now</a></li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18734999">Brave taking Cryptocurrency donations &quot;for me&quot; without my consent</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to run Spark 3.0 applications on your GPU]]></title><description><![CDATA[Wanted to run your Spark job on a GPU but didn't know how?

A few days after that, Spark 3.0 released on 18th June 2020. While it did release, there were no mentions of how to run your Spark 3.0 code on a GPU anywhere on the internet. <strong>It changes now.</strong></p><p>In this post, you&apos;ll see the prerequisites for running Spark on GPU on a local machine, as well as all installation instructions.</p><h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3><p>To run Spark applications on your GPU, it is recommended that you have an <strong>Nvidia GPU </strong>of<strong> Pascal Architecture</strong> or better. This means that you will need an <strong>Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050 or better</strong>. Other requirements are the same as Apache Spark requirements.</p><p><em>(PS. I don&apos;t have an AMD GPU, so can&apos;t really test and confirm whether this will work with it or not, but chances are very slim as you need a tool called <code>nvidia-smi</code>, which works only with Nvidia GPUs)</em></p><p>You will also need to install <a href="https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html">Apache Spark 3.0</a>, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads">Nvidia CUDA</a> on your machine.</p><p>Other than these, you will also need 2 JARs: <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.nvidia/rapids-4-spark_2.12">Rapids Accelerator</a> and <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ai/rapids/cudf/0.15/">NVIDIA CUDF</a> (for CUDA 11).</p><p>You will also need a Linux system to run your jobs. This won&apos;t work on Windows as CUDF isn&apos;t supported on that platform. However, the CUDF team says they will support CUDA Running on WSL 2.0. To get CUDA Running with WSL, you&apos;ll need to be a part of the Windows Insider Program.</p><p>You will also need a GPU Discovery script which tells the program the addresses of GPUs available on your system. Fortunately, the Spark repo has a <a href="https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/examples/src/main/scripts/getGpusResources.sh">GPU discovery script</a> handy which can be readily used.</p><h3 id="running">Running</h3><p>For Spark 3.0 to recognize that you will be running your jobs on a GPU, you need to pass a few parameters as Spark confs:</p><ul><li><code>spark.rapids.sql.enabled</code> as <code>true</code></li><li><code>spark.plugins</code> as <code>com.nvidia.spark.SQLPlugin</code></li><li><code>spark.driver.resource.gpu.discoveryScript</code> as &lt;The location where you have downloaded the GPU discovery script from above&gt;</li></ul><p>You can either run this with <code>spark-shell</code> or you can create your own JAR and run it using <code>spark-submit</code> and then pass these configurations.</p><h3 id="performance">Performance</h3><p>In order to illustrate the performance difference between running your Spark program on a CPU vs GPU, I will be using a very simple program which is very much self explanatory:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code>val values: List[Int] = List(100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 500000, 1000000, 5000000, 10000000, 50000000, 100000000, 500000000, 1000000000)

for (upperBound &lt;- values) {
    val df = sc.makeRDD(1 to upperBound).toDF(&quot;a&quot;)
    val df2 = sc.makeRDD(1 to upperBound).toDF(&quot;b&quot;)
    println(df.join(df2, $&quot;a&quot; === $&quot;b&quot; / 2).count())
}</code></pre><figcaption>Spark program for testing performance: CPU vs GPU</figcaption></figure><p>Further, in order to level the playing field between the 2 runs, I&apos;m setting certain common configs:</p><ul><li><code>spark.locality.wait</code> = <code>0s</code></li><li><code>spark.driver.memory</code> = <code>10G</code></li><li><code>spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes</code> = <code>512 * 1024 * 1024</code></li><li><code>spark.sql.shuffle.partitions</code> = <code>10</code></li></ul><p>Here are the specs of the laptop which I used to perform this test:</p><ul><li>6-core Intel Core i7-8750H</li><li>16GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB NVME SSD</li><li>8GB Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Graphics Card</li></ul><p>Here are two plots showing the <code>upperBound</code> against time taken:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!DOCTYPE html>

In a majority of datasets, you might always find null, or incomplete values. The data would also be inconsistent across columns, which directly affects algorithms using distance measures.</p><p>This is where Data Preprocessing comes in.

The lowest value of the original range gets value of 0, and the highest gets the value 1. All the other values in the original range will fall between these two. </p><p>This is important because there may be multiple attributes with different ranges. <em>E.g. Salary values may range between 3 and 8+ digit numbers, years in company will be between 1- and 2-digit numbers. </em>The reason we want to normalize those attributes in a <code>[0,1]</code> range is so that when algorithms that use distance as a measure, they don&apos;t weigh some attributes like salary more heavily than others.</p><p>The formula to convert values in an un-normalized column to a normalized form is given by:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/image-5.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cool Spark ML - Part 2: Preprocessing of Data" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Normalization Formula</figcaption></figure><p>Where:</p><ul><li><code>x</code> is the value inside a column to be normalized, </li><li><code>x(new)</code> is the normalized value,</li><li><code>x(min)</code> is the minimum value of that column, and</li><li><code>x(max)</code> is the maximum value of that column</li></ul><p>Working on the <code>featuresDf</code> created above, we will import <code>MinMaxScaler</code> from the <code>org.apache.spark.ml.feature</code> package. We now have to create an instance of the <code>MinMaxScaler</code>. It will take two parameters: Input column name, and an Output Column name. This object will transform the contents of the input column vectors into a scaled version, and save it into the output column.</p><p>In our case, we will be using our <code>features</code> column inside <code>featuresDf</code> as the input column, and our output column will be named <code>sFeatures</code>. We create the instance in this manner:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">val featureScaler = new MinMaxScaler()
    .setInputCol(&quot;features&quot;)
    .setOutputCol(&quot;sfeatures&quot;)</code></pre><figcaption>Creating the <code>MinMaxScaler</code> object.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, we have to <code>fit</code> the data present in our <code>featuresDf</code> inside this <code>featureScaler</code> and later <code>transform</code> to create the scaled data. This is done using the code below:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">val scaledDf = featureScaler.fit(featuresDf)
	.transform(featuresDf)</code></pre><figcaption>Transforming original values into normalized ones</figcaption></figure><p>Now, if we have a look at our transformed data:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/image-4.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cool Spark ML - Part 2: Preprocessing of Data" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Normalized <code>DataFrame</code></figcaption></figure><p>You can then use this new <code>sFeatures</code> to calculate distances among points.</p><h3 id="standardize">Standardize</h3><p>Now, we may have data whose values can be mapped to a bell-shaped curve, or normally distributed but maybe not exactly. With standardization, we map our data and transform it, which has a variance of 1 and/or a mean value of 0. This is done because some machine learning algorithms, like SVM, work better this way.</p><p>Thus, what happens is when we apply standardization, our data is slightly shifted in its shape so that it becomes more normalized, or more like a bell curve. The formula to convert values in a non-standardized column to a standardized form is given by:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cool Spark ML - Part 2: Preprocessing of Data" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Standardization Formula</figcaption></figure><p>Where:</p><ul><li><code>x</code> is the value to be standardized</li><li><code>x(new)</code> is the standardized value</li><li><code>&#x3BC;</code> is the mean of the column</li><li><code>&#x3C3;</code> is the standard deviation of the column.</li></ul><p>Again, we will be using the <code>featuresDf</code> created above. We will import <code>StandardScaler</code> from the <code>org.apache.spark.ml.feature</code> package. Just like <code>MinMaxScaler</code>, an instance of <code>StandardScaler</code> will require an input column and an output column. In our case, we will still continue with <code>features</code> and <code>sFeatures</code>. We will then <code>fit</code> the data inside the scaler and later <code>transform</code> the data. I&apos;ve combined both these steps into a single code snippet:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">val featureStandardScaler = new StandardScaler()
    .setInputCol(&quot;features&quot;)
    .setOutputCol(&quot;sfeatures&quot;)
    .setWithStd(true)

    .transform(featuresDf)</code></pre><figcaption>Standardization of numeric data in Spark ML</figcaption></figure><p>Now if we have a look at our transformed data:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/image-8.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cool Spark ML - Part 2: Preprocessing of Data" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Standardized Numeric Data</figcaption></figure><p>Wait, weren&apos;t the values supposed to be scaled within the range of <code>[-1, 1]</code>? Well, that&apos;s the surprise associated with the <code>StandardScaler</code>. It uses the unbiased sample standard deviation instead of the population standard deviation. </p><p>In other words, while the standard deviation will be 1 (or very close to 1), the mean may not be necessarily 0. To scale your data in a way that the range of numbers is between <code>[-1,1]</code> and the standard deviation is 1 and mean 0, you will have to follow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/51755387/2451763">this accepted StackOverflow answer</a>. Even otherwise with this process, the data has been standardized.</p><h3 id="bucketize">Bucketize</h3><p>Bucketization is done when we have to organize continuous ranges of data into different buckets. <code>Bucketizer</code> allows us to group data based on boundaries, so a list of boundaries has to be provided. I will call it <code>splits</code> with the domain of all buckets when added looks like: <code>{(-&#x221E;, -500.0) &#x22C3; [-500.0, -100.0) &#x22C3; [-100.0, -10.0) &#x22C3; [-10.0, 0.0) &#x22C3; [0.0, 10.0) &#x22C3; [10.0, 100.0) &#x22C3; [100.0, 500.0) &#x22C3; [500.0, &#x221E;)}</code>.</p><p>Then I&apos;ll generate 1000 random points that fall in the range of <code>[-10000.0, 10000.0]</code> and save it in a <code>DataFrame</code> with column name as <code>features</code>. This is done using the below code:</p><pre><code class="language-scala">val splits = Array(Float.NegativeInfinity, -500.0, -100.0, -10.0, 0.0, 10.0, 100.0, 500.0, Float.PositiveInfinity)

val bucketData = (for (i &lt;- 0 to 10000) yield math.random * 10000.0 * (if (math.random &lt; 0.5) -1 else 1))
val bucketDf = bucketData.toDF(&quot;features&quot;)</code></pre><p>Now, our <code>Bucketizer</code> needs three inputs: the splits, input column name, and output column name. Then I&apos;ll <code>transform</code> that data which would then give me the element and which bucket it belongs to:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">val bucketizer = new Bucketizer()
    .setSplits(splits)
    .setInputCol(&quot;features&quot;)
    .setOutputCol(&quot;bfeatures&quot;)

val bucketedDf = bucketizer.transform(bucketDf)</code></pre><figcaption>Bucketizing Numeric Data in Spark</figcaption></figure><p>Notice that I didn&apos;t have to do a <code>fit</code> operation before doing a <code>transform</code>. This is because Bucketizing is fairly simple and you only need to find which bucket a number belongs to. Thus, there are no operations like scaling which happened in the other 2 sections, and hence you don&apos;t need to <code>fit</code> your data. Now if we have a look at the created <code>DataFrame</code>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cool Spark ML - Part 2: Preprocessing of Data" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Bucketized DataFrame</figcaption></figure><p>Now you might also want to know how many numbers are there in a particular bucket. So, I will do a <code>groupBy</code> on <code>bFeatures</code> column and retrieve the count of occurrences. The following code does that and displays my generated data:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/image-10.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cool Spark ML - Part 2: Preprocessing of Data" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Fairly easy, isn&apos;t it?</p><h2 id="text">Text</h2><p>There are two ways in which you can preprocess text-based data in Spark:</p><ul><li>Tokenize</li><li>TF-IDF</li></ul><p>To illustrate both of them, I will be using <code>sentencesDf</code> created using this code:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">val sentencesDf = Seq(
    (1, &quot;This is an introduction to Spark ML&quot;),
    (2, &quot;MLLib includes libraries for classification and regression&quot;),
    (3, &quot;It also contains supporting tools for pipelines&quot;)
).toDF(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;sentence&quot;)</code></pre><figcaption>Creating a <code>DataFrame</code> of sentences</figcaption></figure><h3 id="tokenize">Tokenize</h3><p>In tokenization, you map your string containing a sentence into a set of tokens, or words. As an Example, the sentence <em>&quot;This is an introduction to Spark ML&quot;</em> can be mapped into a list of 7 words - <code>{This, is, an, introduction, to, Spark, ML}</code>.</p><p>We will first import <code>Tokenizer</code> from the <code>org.apache.spark.ml.feature</code> package. Now an instance of this will need two parameters - input column and output column. Our input will be <code>sentence</code> and the output will be <code>words</code>, because that is what the <code>Tokenizer</code> will produce. Then we will apply <code>transform</code> on the sentences above.</p><p>Now, just like bucketing, we are not <code>fit</code>ting any data here. <code>Tokenizer</code> already knows its job - Split strings into the separate words. The above process is illustrated in the code below:</p><pre><code class="language-scala">val sentenceToken = new Tokenizer()
    .setInputCol(&quot;sentence&quot;)
    .setOutputCol(&quot;words&quot;)

val sentenceTokenizedDf = sentenceToken.transform(sentencesDf)</code></pre><p>Now, if we have a look at our data:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/image-11.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cool Spark ML - Part 2: Preprocessing of Data" loading="lazy"></figure><p>The <code>words</code> column contains lists of words that have been broken up in the ways you would expect a regular expression pattern matching to break up a sentence into words - based on white space, punctuation, etc. </p><p>Easy, isn&apos;t it?</p><h3 id="term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency-tf-idf-">Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)</h3><p>Here we map text from a single, typically long string, to a vector, indicating the frequency of each word in a text relative to a group of texts such as a corpus. This transformation is widely used in text classification. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/image-12.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cool Spark ML - Part 2: Preprocessing of Data" loading="lazy"></figure><p>TF-IDF captures the intuition that infrequently used words are more useful for distinguishing categories of text than frequently used words. Considering the above figure as an example, <em>Normalizing </em>appears only once, <em>to</em> appears twice and so on. Like this, we go through all the documents in our corpus, which is nothing but a collection of documents. Then we count up how often a term appears across all of the documents. In this example <em>normalizing </em>is a very rare word. Whereas other words like <em>maps, data</em> and <em>to</em> show up more frequently. We use these two sets of counts and feed those two into the term frequency-inverse document frequency calculation. And that gives us our TF-IDF measures.</p><p>I will use the same <code>sentenceTokenizedDf</code> created above for this exercise as well. Just like other processes mentioned above, we will need to import a few things from <code>org.apache.spark.ml.feature</code> package - <code>HashingTF</code> (for hashing Term Frequency), <code>IDF</code> (for Inverse Document Frequency), <code>Tokenizer</code>.</p><p>First, I will create a <code>HashingTF</code> instance - which takes an input column (<code>words</code>), an output column (<code>rawFeatures</code>) &#xA0;and the number of features to keep track of (<code>20</code>) as the parameters. Now we apply our <code>transform</code>ation on this and get a new <code>DataFrame</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-scala">val hashingTF = new HashingTF()
    .setInputCol(&quot;words&quot;)
    .setOutputCol(&quot;rawFeatures&quot;)
    .setNumFeatures(20)

val sentenceHashingFunctionTermFrequencyDf = hashingTF.transform(sentenceTokenizedDf)
sentenceHashingFunctionTermFrequencyDf.show()</code></pre><p>Now if we have a look at our data, it has added an extra column which is of <code>Vector</code> type. It has mapped each word to an index, so for example, <em>this</em> maps to 1, <em>is </em>maps to 4, <em>an </em>-&gt; 5, and so on. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cool Spark ML - Part 2: Preprocessing of Data" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Now we&apos;re going to scale the <code>rawFeatures</code> vector values and we&apos;re going to scale them based on how often the words appear in the entire collection of sentences. To do this we&apos;re going to create an <code>IDF</code> instance. Again, we have to specify an input column (<code>rawFeatures</code>) and an output column (<code>idfFeatures</code>) as parameters.</p><p>Let&apos;s use the term frequency data we just calculated to <code>fit</code> the inverse document frequency model. And to do that I&apos;m going to create an <code>idfModel</code>, and we&apos;re going to call the <code>idf</code> object I just created, and I&apos;m going to fit it using our term frequency data. Then we apply the IDF <code>transform</code>ation to create a new <code>DataFrame</code> that has both the term frequency and the inverse document frequency transformations applied.</p><pre><code class="language-scala">val idf = new IDF()
    .setInputCol(&quot;rawFeatures&quot;)
    .setOutputCol(&quot;idfFeatures&quot;)

val idfModel = idf.fit(sentenceHashingFunctionTermFrequencyDf)
val tfIdfDf = idfModel.transform(sentenceHashingFunctionTermFrequencyDf)</code></pre><p>Now if we have a look at our data (I&apos;m selecting only the <code>rawFeatures</code> and <code>idfFeatures</code> columns to fit in the screen):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cool Spark ML - Part 2: Preprocessing of Data" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Now we have a new column which contains the inverse document frequency features. These are measures of each word relative to how frequently they occur in the entire corpus. In our case our corpus is just three sentences.</p><h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2><p>Preprocessing is indeed a tough challenge where you will have to know what kinds of data you might get and what kinds of processing you want to apply on your data. If not done properly, your machine learning models might not be of much use.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My journey to 10k post views on LinkedIn]]></title><description><![CDATA[My LinkedIn posts' Views and Reaction Count went up by 100x and 20x respectively.

Likes were usually single digit numbers, if not 0. 0 Comments. Period.</p><p>Whereas, the people I was following, had a lot of likes and comments on their posts. When I had a look at their posts, their content was very well structured. Their posts were written as if they were telling a story. Then I realized they used to like and comment on these posts because they were able to relate themselves to it.</p><p>Later, when I had a look at my posts on LinkedIn, they never had content. They used to be mostly reshares of someone else&apos;s content. You can see a few examples below, along with the view count of that post:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Annotation-2020-05-18-220045.png" width="551" height="743" loading="lazy" alt="My journey to 10k post views on LinkedIn"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Annotation-2020-05-18-220125.png" width="552" height="650" loading="lazy" alt="My journey to 10k post views on LinkedIn"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Annotation-2020-05-18-220257.png" width="550" height="728" loading="lazy" alt="My journey to 10k post views on LinkedIn"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Annotation-2020-05-18-220108-1.png" width="554" height="572" loading="lazy" alt="My journey to 10k post views on LinkedIn"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/Annotation-2020-05-18-220330-1.png" width="550" height="405" loading="lazy" alt="My journey to 10k post views on LinkedIn"></div></div></div><figcaption>How my LinkedIn posts looked like before.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="what-triggered-a-change">What triggered a change?</h2><p>Around March 2020, I saw an amazing article on a website which gave a glimpse on the new features coming to Spark 3.0 (You can find that post <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/glimpse-into-spark-3-0-early-access-c1854327d6c">here</a>). This time around, while sharing this post on LinkedIn, I decided to put in my thoughts on what I felt about the release of Spark 3. Find this post below:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:6645553272264491009" height="376" width="504" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen title="Embedded post"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This was the first time the View count on any of my posts stepped into the triple-figure mark. This was also the first time the Reaction count on my posts touched 5 (the previous best at this point was 3, as shown in the screenshot above).</p><p>Because there&apos;s always a first time for everything ;)</p><p>This was the time I realized that if I put my thoughts on what I felt about something, I would surely gain more views and likes. I definitely wanted to grow more on LinkedIn and realized that I had to put my content in a better way that people don&apos;t find crowded. (That embedded post above had only 1 paragraph which felt cluttered).</p><h2 id="the-guru">The Guru</h2><p>Around a month later, I saw one of my connections, Vaibhav Sisinty commenting on people&apos;s posts about his 5-Day LinkedIn workshop. That&apos;s not just once. I saw his comments on multiple people&apos;s posts.</p><p>While reading the posts, I actually felt that this isn&apos;t promotion going on. People are telling their experiences out of the workshop. People were telling the steps they executed and were also showing the results they achieved.</p><p>The cost of the workshop was a measly Rs. 500. It isn&apos;t a huge amount where we would have to empty our pockets to grow. I actually contemplated on whether to join his workshop or not a lot. I was in a dilemma because I was just another (inexperienced) software developer on LinkedIn, amongst 1000s of others. I also had other thoughts on my mind - whether this will workshop will help me as a software developer or not.</p><p>Then I took a leap of faith... and joined his 5-Day LinkedIn Workshop.</p><h2 id="the-workshop">The workshop</h2><p>I was a part of Batch 3 of his workshop, which ran from 5th-11th May. In short, the content of the workshop was divided into a few parts, each taken over a period of 5 days (actually 6, because he gave one extra day off to complete one of the tasks):</p><ul><li>Understanding Target Audience</li><li>Optimizing LinkedIn profile</li><li>Connect with the target audience</li><li>Create good content</li></ul><p>The content for each of those points in the workshop was well defined. He had recorded sessions for each of those 5 days, and at 9PM he used to have a Live Q&amp;A session of that day&apos;s topic. Despite all of the above, execution is key. </p><p>&quot;No Execution, No Results&quot;. </p><p>This is one of the golden words Vaibhav used to frequently tell inside his videos and the Facebook and WhatsApp groups {Yes, he used to engage with us on WhatsApp as well ;) }. He would also send reminder emails (I guess he sent around 50-70 such mails) to me (and I guess each participant).</p><h2 id="the-content-boom">The content boom</h2><p>Ever since the workshop, I posted few contents, whose views and Reaction count were significantly higher than any of my previous posts.

At the GPU Technology Conference, both the companies have presented a solution that brings GPU Acceleration to Spark 3.0 without major code changes.</p><h2 id="how-things-were-before">How things were before?</h2><p>GPU based solutions have existed for Spark for a long time, so what has changed?</p><p>Such GPU integrations into Spark were provided by either third party libraries in Java/Scala, or you had to depend on Cloud Providers which would provide such an infrastructure to run Spark on GPU. Also, programs would usually be restricted to applications based on Spark ML, thus they generally couldn&apos;t be applied to other Big Data uses on Scale.</p><p>When it comes to Spark/Python, you had to use custom tools like Horovod, which would also end up using popular Python based libraries like Numpy and Tensorflow. Thus, this approach severely limits the performance of the Spark Programs due to the nature of Python, where programs are dynamically interpreted. </p><p>Don&apos;t get me wrong, Python has its very own unique use-cases which Scala doesn&apos;t provide (yet), but because Spark was built to do Big Data operations effectively, Python severely restricts the performance.</p><h2 id="what-happened-now">What happened now?</h2><p>With the release of Spark 3.0, native GPU based acceleration will be provided within Spark.

Building upon this deal, Adobe has been an early adopter for this new GPU Acceleration on Spark, and they have shown a 7x improvement in performance of their workloads, while saving up to 90% of the costs. </p><p>These are serious numbers. Imagine, if a company as huge as Adobe is able to bring down costs while improving performance, other companies too can follow suit and we could see Profits and Performance for everyone. Period.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Imagine how game changing this can prove to be for the Big Data community overall. No longer will we have to wait for operations to complete when we can utilize the GPU, we have on our local Gaming PCs and laptops. We will also be able to utilize GPU servers on Cloud for Spark without doing major changes.</p><p>This can also encourage many people to start using Scala for AI and Machine Learning instead of Python. While I do realize that there are no major visualization libraries supporting Spark available in Scala, an encouragement to do machine learning with Spark shall bring more enthusiasm for Scala, due to the disadvantages I mentioned for Python above. This in turn will lead to a growth in the Scala community, which will further result in availability of more and more libraries. </p><p>For now, there is a Scala visualization library that supports Spark, in active development, which when released to MVN Repository could be a game changer.

As you might have guessed, this is nothing but computing the factorial of a particular number.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">def recursiveProd(x: Int): BigInt = {
    if (x &lt;= 1) 
        return 1
    else 
        return x * recursiveProd(x-1)
}</code></pre><figcaption>Recursive Factorial Program</figcaption></figure><p>Let us see how this function is being executed as a whole assuming we executed <code>recursiveProd(5)</code>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code>recursiveProd(5)  
5 * recursiveProd(4)  
    (4 * recursiveProd(3))  
         (3 * recursiveProd(2))
              (2 * recursiveProd(1))  
                   1 
120</code></pre><figcaption>Recursive Factorial Steps</figcaption></figure><p>From above, each recursive call has to be completed first before the actual work of calculating the product begins. Each recursive call saves the current state, and proceeds to call the next recursive function. This happens repeatedly until the base case is reached. In between, you might also encounter the Stack Overflow error. </p><p>So, in each step you execute 2 steps, retrieve the current value and the value from the next stage (as a recursive call), and then multiply them. Subsequent recursive calls will do the same. If you can visualize this correctly, you will notice this recursive call was completed in <strong>14 computations </strong>(4 multiplications, 5 recursive calls, 5 returning values), with computations happening in each step.</p><h3 id="tail-recursion">Tail Recursion</h3><p>Now let&#x2019;s consider Tail Recursion. In Tail Recursion, all the processing related to the recursive function must finish before the recursive call takes place. This means that <strong>if a function is tail-recursive, the last action is a call to itself</strong>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">def tailRecursiveProd(x: Int, currentTotal: BigInt): BigInt = {
    if (x &lt;= 1) 
        return currentTotal
    else 
        return tailRecursiveProd(x - 1, currentTotal * x)
}</code></pre><figcaption>Tail-Recursive Factorial Program</figcaption></figure><p>In this scenario, despite there being a multiplication operation, it happens when the argument is passed to the next recursive call. In short, we send the current state of the recursive call to the next state, and the same process will be repeated until the base case is reached. Let us see how this is executed:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">recursiveProd(5,1)
recursiveProd(4,5)
recursiveProd(3,20)
recursiveProd(2,60)
recursiveProd(1,120)
120</code></pre><figcaption>Tail-Recursive Factorial Steps</figcaption></figure><p>In this way, we can save up additional stack memory which would&apos;ve otherwise be wasted to compute the multiplications at every return step. Thus, this implementation only takes 10 computations (5 recursive calls, 5 returning values). This is equivalent of you using a loop to process the factorial.</p><p>Thus, you should always try and convert your recursive function into a tail recursive function wherever possible.</p><h3 id="tail-recursion-in-scala">Tail Recursion in Scala</h3><p>One good thing about Scala is that it automatically recognizes two types of tail-recursive methods automatically and optimizes them. These types are:</p><ol><li>Methods within an <code>object</code></li><li>Methods defined as <code>final</code></li></ol><p>Sadly, if you write a non-<code>final</code> tail-recursive function inside a <code>class</code>, or even a <code>case class</code>, it will not be automatically optimized by the Scala Compiler because a <code>class</code> can be <code>extend</code>ed and these methods can be <code>override</code>n. Consider my code given below:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">object Bm {
    def nTailRecursion(n: Int): Int = {
        if (n == 0) 1 else nTailRecursion(n - 1)
    }
}

case class Bm() {
    def tailRecursion(n: Int): Int = {
        if (n == 0) 1 else tailRecursion(n - 1)
    }

    final def tailsRecursion(n: Int): Int = {
        if (n == 0) 1 else tailsRecursion(n - 1)
    }
}</code></pre><figcaption>Illustrating various cases of tail-recursive methods</figcaption></figure><p>You can see that all these functions are doing the same task. Now:</p><ol><li>Start a Scala REPL (Install Scala on your machine, then type <code>scala</code> on your command line/terminal and press Enter)</li><li>Type <code>:paste</code> and press Enter</li><li>Paste the code snippet above</li><li>Press <code>Ctrl-D</code> to exit the paste mode</li></ol><p>Then, try running <code>Bm.nTailRecursion(60000)</code> and <code>Bm().tailsRecursion(60000)</code>. I&apos;ve tried that on my current laptop with an Intel i7-8750H processor and 16GB RAM, and both of them worked fine. Now, when you try running <code>Bm().tailRecursion(60000)</code>, you see a familiar <code>java.lang.StackOverflowError</code> which usually occurs with recursive function:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Tail Recursion: Why and How-to Use in Scala" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Sure, you could play around with the JVM memory limits and possibly execute this function properly. You must always remember that memory is an intensive resource, and non-availability of memory might crash other programs, as well as your current program.</p><p>Fortunately, Scala provides the <code>@tailrec</code> annotation to denote that a method is actually tail-recursive. First you will have to import <code>scala.annotation.tailrec</code> and place that annotation before the function you want to mark as tail-recursive. Place this annotation before <code>tailRecursion()</code> inside the <code>case class</code> and now copy-paste inside the REPL and try again. This time it won&apos;t throw the dreaded <code><code>java.lang.StackOverflowError</code></code> Exception.</p><h3 id="convert-a-recursive-function-to-a-tail-recursive-function">Convert a recursive function to a tail-recursive function</h3><p>In some cases, you might want to retain the original method&apos;s signature (eg. Factorial). This can be done using the following steps:</p><p>1. Create a second function</p><p>Within the <code>recursiveProd</code> as defined in the first code piece above, we now define another method, <code>cumulativeRecursion</code> with two parameters: <code>n</code>, our number and <code>res</code>, the result of recursion. We retain the algorithm of the first method as is. At this point our new method looks like:</p><pre><code class="language-scala">def recursiveProd(n: Int): Int = {
    def cumulativeRecursion(n: Int, res: Int): Int = {
        if (n &lt;= 1) 1
        else n * recursiveProd(n - 1)
    }
}</code></pre><p>2. Modify the second method&apos;s algorithm</p><p>We will now utilize the accumulator we&apos;ve just created, <code>res</code> and modify the function such that the base case returns the accumulated value and the other case recursively calls the new method again:</p><pre><code>def recursiveProd(n: Int): Int = {
    def cumulativeRecursion(n: Int, res: Int): Int = {
        if (n &lt;= 1) res
        else cumulativeRecursion(n - 1, res * n)
    }
}</code></pre><p>3. Annotate the second method and call the new method</p><p>We will now annotate our new method with <code>@tailrec</code> as shown earlier and we will now call this method from our original method:</p><pre><code class="language-scala">def recursiveProd(n: Int): Int = {
    @tailrec def cumulativeRecursion(n: Int, res: Int): Int = {
        if (n &lt;= 1) res
        else cumulativeRecursion(n - 1, res * n)
    }
    cumulativeRecursion(n, 1)
}</code></pre><p>Hence, you retain your method&apos;s original signature, as well as converted it into a tail-recursive call (Though this will add 1 extra stack call to the new function).</p><h3 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h3><p>In this post, I have:</p><ul><li>Defined Tail Recursion</li><li>Introduced <code>@tailrec</code> annotation</li><li>Shown a formula to convert a recursive function into a tail-recursive one.</li></ul><p>Hope you have enjoyed this post.

Other parts are coming soon.</em></p><p>I had taken up a few machine learning courses in my college throughout 2018. Most of the problems there were solved using Python and the necessary libraries - NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Matplotlib. With my daily work at IBM now requiring me to use Scala and Spark, I decided to use my free time during the lockdown to try out Spark ML.</p><p><em>Note: All the codes in the Cool Spark ML Series will be available on <a href="https://github.com/Sparker0i/Cool-Spark-ML">my GitHub repo</a></em></p><h3 id="intro-to-spark-ml">Intro to Spark ML</h3><p>As the name suggests, Spark ML is the Machine Learning library consisting of common Machine learning algorithms - classification, regression, clustering etc.</p><h3 id="why-spark-ml">Why Spark ML?</h3><p>Pandas - a Python library - won&#x2019;t work every time. It is a single machine tool, so it&apos;s constrained by the machine&apos;s limits. Moreover, pandas doesn&#x2019;t have any parallelism built in, which means it uses only one CPU core. You may hit a dead-end on datasets of the size of a few gigabytes. Pandas won&apos;t help if you want to work on very big datasets.</p><p>We are now in the Big Data era, where gigabytes of data are generated every few seconds. Such datasets will require powerful systems to run even the basic machine learning algorithms. The cost of getting such a powerful system will be huge, as well as the costs to scale them up. With distributed computers, such calculations can be sent to multiple low-end machines, which prevents the cost of getting a single high-end machine.</p><p>This is where Spark kicks in. Spark has the concept of <code>DataFrame</code> (now deprecated in favor of Datasets), which behaves very similar to how a Pandas <code>DataFrame</code> would do, including having very similar APIs too. The advantage of using Spark <code>DataFrame</code> is that it was designed from ground-up to support Big Data. Spark can also distribute such <code>DataFrame</code>s across multiple machines and collect the calculated results.</p><h3 id="knn-k-nearest-neighbors">KNN: K-Nearest Neighbors</h3><p>The process in KNN is pretty simple. You load your entire dataset first, each of which will have input columns and one output column. This is then split into a training set and a testing set. You then use your training set to train your model, and then use the testing set to predict the output column value by testing it against the model. You then compare the actual and the predicted target values and calculate the accuracy of your model.</p><h3 id="problem-definition">Problem Definition</h3><p>We are going to train a model to predict the famous <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris">Iris dataset</a>. The Iris Flower Dataset involves predicting the flower species given measurements of iris flowers.</p><p>It is a multiclass classification problem. The number of observations for each class is the same. The dataset is small in size with only 150 rows with 4 input variables and 1 output variable.</p><p>The 4 features are described as follows:</p><ol><li>Sepal-Length, in cm</li><li>Sepal-Width, in cm</li><li>Petal-Length, in cm</li><li>Petal-Width, in cm</li></ol><h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3><ol><li>Create a Scala project in IntelliJ IDEA based on SBT</li><li>Select Scala version 2.11.12</li><li>Include <code>spark-core</code>, <code>spark-sql</code> and <code>spark-ml</code> 2.4.5 as library dependencies in your <code>build.sbt</code></li></ol><h3 id="knn-steps">KNN Steps</h3><p>In this blog post, I will be developing KNN algorithm from scratch. The process to perform KNN can be broken down into 3 easy steps:</p><ol><li>Calculate Euclidean Distance</li><li>Get Nearest Neighbors</li><li>Make Predictions</li></ol><h3 id="step-1-calculate-euclidean-distance">Step 1: Calculate Euclidean Distance</h3><p>The first step will be to calculate the distance between two rows in a Dataset. Rows of data are mostly made up of numbers and an easy way to calculate the distance between two rows or vectors of numbers is to draw a straight line.</p><p>Euclidean Distance is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the two vectors, as given in the image below:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&amp;space;\bg_white&amp;space;{\color{Red}&amp;space;$$dist_{x_1,x_2}&amp;space;=&amp;space;\sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{N}&amp;space;({x_1_i&amp;space;-&amp;space;x_2_i})^2}.$$}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&amp;space;\bg_white&amp;space;{\color{Red}&amp;space;$$dist_{x_1,x_2}&amp;space;=&amp;space;\sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{N}&amp;space;({x_1_i&amp;space;-&amp;space;x_2_i})^2}.$$}" title="{\color{Red} $$dist_{p_1,p_2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{N} ({x_1_i - x_2_i})^2}.$$}" alt="Cool Spark ML: K Nearest Neighbors"></a><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Where <code>x1</code> is the first row of data, <code>x2</code> is the second row of data, and <code>i</code> is a specific index for a column as we sum across all columns. Smaller the value, more similar will be the two rows.</p><p>Since we will be reading our data and transforming it using Spark, to compute distances between two <code>Row</code>s in a <code>DataFrame</code>, we write the function below in Scala:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">def computeEuclideanDistance(row1: Row, row2: Row): Double = {
    var distance = 0.0
    for (i &lt;- 0 until row1.length - 1) {
        distance += math.pow(row1.getDouble(i) - row2.getDouble(i), 2)
    }
    math.sqrt(distance)
}</code></pre><figcaption>Code to compute Euclidean Distance</figcaption></figure><p>You can see that the function assumes that the last column in each row is an output value which is ignored from the distance calculation.</p><h3 id="step-2-get-nearest-neighbors">Step 2: Get Nearest Neighbors</h3><p>Neighbors for a new piece of data in the dataset are the k closest instances, as defined by our distance measure. To locate the neighbors for a new piece of data within a dataset we must first calculate the distance between each record in the dataset to the new piece of data. We can do this using our distance function prepared above.</p><p>We can do this by keeping track of the distance for each record in the dataset as a tuple, sort the list of tuples by the distance, and then retrieve the neighbors. The below function does this job in Scala:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">def getNeighbours(trainSet: Array[Row], testRow: Row, k: Int): List[Row] = {
    var distances = mutable.MutableList[(Row, Double)]()
    trainSet.foreach{trainRow =&gt;
        val dist = computeEuclideanDistance(trainRow, testRow)
        val x = (trainRow, dist)
        distances += x
    }
    distances = distances.sortBy(_._2)
    var neighbours = mutable.MutableList[Row]()

    for (i &lt;- 1 to k) {
        neighbours += distances(i)._1
    }
    neighbours.toList
}</code></pre><figcaption>Retrieve The k nearest neighbors for a new data element</figcaption></figure><h3 id="step-3-make-predictions">Step 3: Make Predictions</h3><p>The most similar neighbors collected from the training dataset can be used to make predictions. In the case of classification, we can return the most represented output value (Class) among the neighbors.</p><p>We would first map the class values to the number of times it appears among the neighbors, then sort the counts in descending order and get the most appeared class value. The below function does exactly that in Scala:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">def predictClassification(trainSet: Array[Row], testRow: Row, k: Int): String =
{
    val neighbours = getNeighbours(trainSet, testRow, k)
    val outputValues = for (row &lt;- neighbours) yield row.getString(trainSet(0).length - 1)
    outputValues.groupBy(identity)
        .mapValues(_.size)
        .toSeq
        .sortWith(_._2 &gt; _._2)
        .head._1
}</code></pre><figcaption>Make prediction on the class value of a new data element</figcaption></figure><h3 id="apply-the-above-concepts-to-iris-dataset">Apply the above concepts to Iris Dataset</h3><p>We will now apply the concepts above to perform KNN on the Iris Dataset.</p><p>First, we have to load the dataset into the program. This is done using the <code>readCsv</code> function I&apos;ve written below:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-scala">def readCsv(fileName: String, header: Boolean): DataFrame = {
    spark.read
        .format(&quot;csv&quot;)
        .option(&quot;header&quot;, header)
        .option(&quot;inferSchema&quot;, header)
        .load(fileName)
        .repartition($&quot;Class&quot;)
}</code></pre><figcaption>Code to read a CSV into a DataFrame</figcaption></figure><p>We also have to normalize the data we have. This is because KNN is based on distance between records. Unless data is normalized distance will be incorrectly calculated, because different attributes will not contribute to the distance in a uniform way. &#xA0;Attributes having a larger value range will have an unduly large influence on the distance, because they make greater contribution to the distance. If the dataset requires that some columns be given a greater preference over others, then normalization isn&apos;t recommended, but this is not true in the case of the Iris dataset.</p><p>We use the Z Score Normalization technique. With this, we subtract the mean of the respective column from each cell, and divide that with the standard deviation of that column. <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understand-data-normalization-in-machine-learning-8ff3062101f0">This</a> article describes Data Normalization in good detail.</p><p>The following function does our job:</p><pre><code class="language-scala">def normalizeData(): Unit = {
    df.columns.filterNot(e =&gt; e == &quot;Class&quot;).foreach{col =&gt;
        val (mean_col, stddev_col) = df.select(mean(col), stddev(col))
            .as[(Double, Double)]
            .first()
        df = df.withColumn(s&quot;$col.norm&quot;, ($&quot;$col&quot; - mean_col) / stddev_col)
            .drop(col)
            .withColumnRenamed(s&quot;$col.norm&quot;, col)
    }
}</code></pre><p>As you can see above, we are filtering out the class value, because we will not be using this value to compute the distance. There&apos;s one problem with our approach though, our KNN functions written above assume that the class value will be the last column. In the way we&apos;ve normalized the data, we are dropping the original column, and adding the normalized column in place. This will push the <code>Class</code> column to the beginning. So, I&apos;ve written another function which will move the column back to where it should actually be:</p><pre><code class="language-scala">def moveClassToEnd(): Unit = {
    val cols = df.columns.filterNot(_ == &quot;Class&quot;) ++ Array(&quot;Class&quot;)
    df = df.select(cols.head, cols.tail: _*)
}</code></pre><p>We will evaluate our algorithm using K-fold cross-validation with 5 folds. This means that we will have 150/5 = 30 rows per fold. We will use helper functions <code>evaluateAlgorithm()</code> and <code>accuracyMetric()</code> to evaluate the algorithm for cross-validation and calculate the accuracy of our predictions respectively.</p><p>Since Spark does not allow any of its operations inside a Spark transformation, we will have to perform a <code>collect()</code> on the Train set and Test set <code>DataFrame</code>s every time before passing it to any function.

I&apos;m writing more on this in another blog post which will arrive shortly after this one. </p><p>Functionally, both Spark and Pandas have an almost same set of functionalities, and their APIs are not so different either. There&apos;s one function which is used extensively in the data science community with Pandas - <code><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.shape.html">shape()</a></code>. This function returns you the return the row and column count coupled inside a Tuple. Sadly, this functionality isn&apos;t available with Spark <code>DataFrame</code> (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27756">and won&apos;t come either</a>).</p><h3 id="implicit-classes-in-scala">Implicit classes in Scala</h3><p>Fortunately, we have Implicit classes in Scala for our rescue. Implicit classes enable us to add some new functionality on top of an existing class&apos; functionalities. To know more about Implicit Classes, you can read <a href="http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/ImplicitDesignPatternsinScala.html">this</a> article for diving deep. </p><p>First, we need to define a new implicit class with the method we want to add. In this case, I want to add the <code>shape()</code> function on top of the Spark <code>DataFrame</code> class.</p><pre><code class="language-scala">implicit class DataFramePlus(df: DataFrame) {
    def shape(): (Long, Int) = (df.count(), df.columns.length)
}</code></pre><p>Then all you need to do is print the shape of the <code>DataFrame</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-scala">df = spark.read.format(&quot;&lt;something&gt;&quot;).load(&quot;&lt;Filename&gt;&quot;)
println(df.shape())</code></pre><p>This solved a major pain point for me without having to extend an existing class.</p><h3 id="best-practice">Best Practice</h3><p>While writing these codes inside the Scala REPL (Scala/Spark Shell on Terminal) might seem a little easier to implement, openly exposing your code for everyone to use isn&apos;t a great idea.</p><p>Instead, you could implement the implicit class in a package object like this:</p><pre><code class="language-scala">package me.sparker0i

import org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame

package object machinelearning {
    implicit class DataFramePlus(df: DataFrame) {
        def shape(): (Long, Int) = (df.count(), df.columns.length)
    }
}</code></pre><p>Then you&apos;ll need to add the proper import statement in your class, after which you can use the shape method with any <code>DataFrame</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-scala">package me.sparker0i.machinelearning.regression

import org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame
import me.sparker0i.machinelearning._

class LinearRegression {
    def function(df: DataFrame): Unit = {
    	println(df.shape())
    }
}</code></pre><h3 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h3><p>With this approach of using implicit classes in Scala, we no longer have to extend any existing class just to add additional functionality to it. You define the behavior you want, and then add that behavior to existing class instances after adding the proper <code>import</code> statements.</p><p>Inspired heavily from <a href="https://alvinalexander.com/scala/scala-2.10-implicit-class-example/">Alvin Alexander&apos;s article</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[IPL 2020 Auction experience with RCB]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here's to a dream come true when I got recognized by the RCB for my madness for them.]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/ipl-2020-auction-experience-with-rcb/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">61f016ac0598f2d200c5e158</guid><category><![CDATA[IPL]]></category><category><![CDATA[RCB]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Aaditya Menon]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2019 09:55:23 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/12/77062915_620803191999653_2243580465715061965_n.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/12/77062915_620803191999653_2243580465715061965_n.jpg" alt="IPL 2020 Auction experience with RCB"><p>Everyone reading my blog knows that I am a huge RCB fan (Shame on you if you don&apos;t).

<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/1_fqwE_Sk2pCO5orZTRoivgg.png" alt="MySQL installation inside Docker on Mac"><p>I&#x2019;ve never liked to make changes to my laptop by providing my admin credentials to install various tools, like MySQL because I love doing things at a user level. Programs like VSCode and Atom are good examples of that when all you do is drag the application icon to the Applications folder. Homebrew is also a good example to install command line applications at a user level.</p>



<p>If you were to install using the official installer, you&#x2019;d have to give administrator rights. You will also have to make changes to your bash profile to access mysql in terminal. All these problems can be alleviated by installing a MySQL container inside Docker.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If you&#x2019;re using a Mac and want to use MySQL without making many installation changes, you&#x2019;ve come to the right place.  </p></blockquote>



<h3 id="install-docker">INSTALL DOCKER COMMUNITY EDITION</h3>



<p>Download Docker Desktop for Mac by visiting this <a href="https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&amp;offering=community">link. </a>Then you need to install Docker on your Mac by following the installation steps. It is recommended not to change any defaults if prompted.</p>



<p>Once you are done with that, we will now proceed with the installation of MySQL container inside Docker. You can either do it inside a terminal, or use a tool like Kitematic using which you can manage multiple containers in your system once you create them. </p>



<p>Fire up a terminal, and write this command</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker run --name=mysql -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_USER=developer -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mydbpwd -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb mysql/mysql-server</code></pre>



<p>Here we will use the <code>mysql/mysql-server</code> image, and our Username, password and Database are <code>developer</code>, <code>mydbpwd</code> and <code>mydb</code> respectively. Then do the port mapping between the container and the host. We bind Container&#x2019;s port 3306 to the Mac&#x2019;s port 3306.</p>



<p>If everything goes fine, you should see a combination of alphabets and numbers as an output. This is the container ID. Type this command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker exec -it mysql bash -c &quot;mysql -u developer -p&quot;</code></pre>



<p>Then enter the password you entered while creating the container (In this case <code>mydbpwd</code>). Then you will have an instance up and running inside Docker.</p>



<h3>CHECK MYSQL CONNECTIVITY INSIDE MYSQL WORKBENCH</h3>



<p>First up install MySQL Workbench, either using the official installer or using the brew command <code>brew cask install mysqlworkbench</code>. Once you open up the MySQLWorkbench, click on the add connection button, then enter as following:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image.png" alt="MySQL installation inside Docker on Mac" class="wp-image-678" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image.png 798w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image-300x188.png 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image-768x481.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px"><figcaption>Creating a new connection inside MySQL Workbench<br></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Then click the Test Connection button. If everything goes alright, you will get this popup:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image-1.png" alt="MySQL installation inside Docker on Mac" class="wp-image-679" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image-1.png 420w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2019/03/image-1-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px"><figcaption>Connection established with MySQL Container in Docker</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>



<p>Installing MySQL in Docker on your PC is a safer approach to installing MySQL than providing Admin credentials to install using the official installer. If anything goes wrong, all you have to do is delete the container and create a new one in Docker.</p>

<h3>UNBOXING</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Nokia-7-Plus_fonearena-15-1024x665.jpg" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-508" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Nokia-7-Plus_fonearena-15-1024x665.jpg 1024w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Nokia-7-Plus_fonearena-15-1024x665-300x195.jpg 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Nokia-7-Plus_fonearena-15-1024x665-768x499.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Unboxing Contents. Courtesy: <a href="https://www.fonearena.com/blog/249008/nokia-7-plus-unboxing-first-impressions.html">Fonearena</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you unbox the cover, you will notice a few things available in the package. You will up to a Plastic TPU case bundled, at least in the Indian market. Another thing you will notice is the in-ear earphones, not quite common today. Also, you will notice 2 pairs of earbuds for the earphones, another good thing to have.</p>



<p>We also have the USB type C charging cable bundled. Moreover, you get a Fast charger with this phone, something you expect at this price point. Then we have a 2 pin charger having variable rating reading 5V-2.5A/9V-2A/12V-1.5A. The good news is this is a Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0 supported fast charger, meaning it will take lesser time to charge the phone than your usual 5V/2A charger. Apart from this, you will also see a SIM Ejector tool, a user warranty manual, and some support documents</p>


<!-- nextpage -->



<h3>BODY</h3>



<p>A single Series 6000 Aluminium Block makes up the body of the phone. You will also feel the weight of the Aluminium build in your hands. That being said, this phone is not like the other metal phones that you see in the market. This phone has 6 layers of ceramic coating on the back (this is what HMD Global says ??&#x200D;&#x2642;), which is why you don&#x2019;t see any antenna lines on the back of the phone like other metal phones.</p>



<p>The phone comes in 2 color variants &#x2013; Black/Copper and White/Copper. My phone is the Black/Copper variant, with a matte black back and a copper accent running around the frame, as well as on the sides of the camera, the fingerprint sensor and the Nokia logo written&#xA0;on the back of the phone.</p>



<h4>BACK SIDE</h4>



<p>The phone comes with a dual camera setup with Zeiss lenses, highlighting the company&#x2019;s partnership with HMD Global for the phone. Then there&#x2019;s a dual-tone LED flash on the right of the camera bump. Below the camera, we have a fingerprint sensor, a common feature in all phones now. Also, there exists a secondary noise-cancellation microphone above the camera bump.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Back.jpg" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-513" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Back.jpg 770w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Back-154x300.jpg 154w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Back-768x1496.jpg 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Back-526x1024.jpg 526w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px"><figcaption>Nokia 7 Plus back side</figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps the USP of this phone is the Android One branding written on the lower side of the back. Then there&#x2019;s some more text below it &#x2013; Model Number (TA-1046), Made In India branding, and HMD Global&#x2019;s address. (Don&#x2019;t go by Made In China in the image)</p>



<h4>FRONT SIDE</h4>



<p>Coming to the front, we have a 6-inch 2.5D IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 2160&#xD7;1080 in an 18:9 aspect ratio. Now, this doesn&#x2019;t mean that this is a full-screen phone with&#xA0;bezels on the top and the bottom, and minimal side bezels. Since it is a 2.5D display, it curves towards the edges of the phone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Front.jpg" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-514" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Front.jpg 869w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Front-174x300.jpg 174w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Front-768x1326.jpg 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Front-593x1024.jpg 593w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px"><figcaption>Front Side of Nokia 7 Plus</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the top, we have the proximity sensor, hidden due to the black background. We also have the earpiece, which doesn&#x2019;t double up as a speaker. At last, we have the 16MP front camera, followed by the iconic Nokia logo in the top right corner.</p>



<h4>EDGES</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/left-edge.jpg" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-516" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/left-edge.jpg 1200w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/left-edge-300x225.jpg 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/left-edge-768x576.jpg 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/left-edge-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>Left Edge of Nokia 7 Plus. Courtesy: <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_7_plus-review-1752.php">GSMArena</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>On the left edge of the phone, you will see the SIM card slot. In the Indian variant, this holder can have either 2 nano SIMs or 1 nano SIM and 1 MicroSD Card, with a capacity of up to 256 GB. While other phones around this price point are giving 512 GB of expandable memory, it is sad to see this phone providing only half the storage. Despite this, 64 GB internal storage will not fill up fast.</p>



<p>On the right edge of the phone, you will see the volume buttons and the power button arranged in that particular order. There&#x2019;s a style quotient in the phone because of the copper accent throughout the frame. With the style box checked, the buttons are good. It gives that crisp, tacky sound when clicked. Despite this, it is not too difficult to press those buttons either, you would just press them like on any other phone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/top-and-right.jpg" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-515" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/top-and-right.jpg 1200w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/top-and-right-300x225.jpg 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/top-and-right-768x576.jpg 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/top-and-right-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>Top and right edges of Nokia 7 plus. Courtesy: <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_7_plus-review-1752.php">GSMArena</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>On the top edge, you will only find a headphone jack (luckily, at this price point). I will surely miss the IR blaster from the Redmi Note 3 (my previous phone). On the bottom edge, you will find the microphone, charger input slot as well as the speakers.</p>



<h4>DIMENSIONS AND WEIGHT</h4>



<p>The phone&#x2019;s physical dimensions are 158.4 x 75.6 x 8.0mm. This phone weighs at 183g, 19g more than my previous phone, Redmi Note 3. Despite that, the increase in weight doesn&#x2019;t seem to be much, indicating that the weight has been distributed properly throughout the phone. The weight is definitely better distributed than the Lenovo P1m which weighs 143g. With my experience, the Lenovo P1m felt heavier than this.</p>


<!-- nextpage -->



<h3>DISPLAY</h3>



<p>Given that the display comes in an 18:9 aspect ratio and rounded corners, it seems to follow the modern display trends.&#xA0;There&#x2019;s no OLED display in this phone, but looking at the vibrant colors the display produces, one may mistake this for an OLED screen. In fact, at one look, anyone might mistake this for a Google Pixel 2 XL. The scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 3 shields the phone&#x2019;s display.</p>



<p>I don&#x2019;t know much of technical stuff regarding displays, but I can compare this phone to my old Redmi Note 3. The color reproduction&#xA0;is better than Note 3. Maximum Brightness is slightly less than found on the Note 3. At maximum brightness, the black color seems to be of&#xA0;great quality, though not as great as an OLED, which is why one would mistake the screen for an AMOLED one. Screen legibility under sunlight is far better.</p>



<p>While there are multiple websites reporting that the screen whites tilt towards the blue region, suggesting for cooler colors, my phone does quite the opposite. From the Redmi Note 3 that I have had, the phone seems tinted towards warmer colors.</p>



<h3>BATTERY</h3>



<p>The Nokia 7 Plus carries a 3800 mAh battery, while most flagship phones carry around 3200-3500 mAh battery.</p>



<p>Scenario 1 was a typical day of usage which involved 3.5 hours of gaming, 1.5 hours of web browsing, and the remaining time split across WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Calls, and Music</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-233034.png"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-233034.png" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" data-id="525" data-link="https://sparker0i.me/blog/?attachment_id=525" class="wp-image-525" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-233034.png 1080w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-233034-150x300.png 150w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-233034-768x1536.png 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180825-233034-512x1024.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a><figcaption>Scenario 1</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180827-201058.png"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180827-201058.png" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" data-id="526" data-link="https://sparker0i.me/blog/?attachment_id=526" class="wp-image-526" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180827-201058.png 1080w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180827-201058-150x300.png 150w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180827-201058-768x1536.png 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180827-201058-512x1024.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a><figcaption>Scenario 2</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>Scenario 2 was of an extended gaming day, which involved 2.5 hours of PUBG, another 1.5 hours of Real Cricket 18 and 30 min of Clash of Clans, and the remaining time split across Chrome,&#xA0;WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram. In both the scenarios, my phone was either connected to 4G LTE or to my WiFi router. Internet was always on my phone.</p>



<h3>SCREEN-ON-TIME AND CHARGING</h3>



<p>With such extensive usage in my case, I could get around 5-6 hours of screen-on-time and 12-14 hours of standby. For normal-to-medium usage, the phone should be easily giving you 1.5-2 days of standby, as well as 7-8 hours of screen-on-time.</p>



<p>One good thing&#xA0;in this phone is that it comes with a fast charger out of the box. 30 min of charging should take the phone to ~40% while we could achieve full charge at around 1 hour and 45 minutes. The phone says Charging Rapidly when charging from 0 to 80-82%, then regular charging to 100%. Also, the phone squeezes out the last inch of the battery until it goes down to 0%. This is unlike my Redmi Note 3, which recently started going from 10 to 0 percent charge in only a few minutes, even with the battery saver turned on.</p>



<h3>SPEAKER</h3>



<p>While the speaker loudness is quite good, there are some budget to mid-range phones that provide a louder sound from the speaker unit. Mi A1 is one of them. Another phone with louder sound than this phone is the Moto G5S plus.</p>



<h3>AUDIO CLARITY</h3>



<p>Coming to the audio clarity, the speaker audio may not be clear enough everytime. In a quiet to low-noise surroundings, the speakers are good to use. Once there&#x2019;s some noise, like in a room full of people or while you are in train, the audio clarity would be okay, but the loudness just diminishes.</p>


<!-- nextpage -->



<h3>ANDROID ONE</h3>



<p>Unarguably the USP of this phone, the Android One branding. It&#x2019;s something that every developer craves for. It wouldn&#x2019;t be wrong to stereotype this phone to a Nexus phone, given the software quality. Android One is a boon for anyone that wants something close to stock Android, but doesn&#x2019;t have the budget to buy the Pixel phone series.</p>



<p>Monthly updates are also another plus point with this phone, they are timely. My phone came with Android 8.1 Oreo with the April Security patch out of the box, but the phone downloaded 4 monthly security patches since then in a sequential order and it&#xA0;is currently running on the August Security Patch. There&#x2019;s also an Android Pie final developer preview build, with a stable release set for early September. Given the upgrade policy that we have seen with the last year&#x2019;s Nokia smartphones, Nokia phones will receive Android upgrades way faster than any other non-Google vendor (Okay, Essential Phone beat Nokia for the Android P update, but let&#x2019;s see with the others)</p>



<h4>USER INTERFACE</h4>



<p>After finishing setting up your phone, you would be looking at your launcher. This looks similar to the launcher found on the Pixel phones. It has a dock which can house a maximum of 5 app icons, or in general 5 folders. Then there&#x2019;s an app drawer which is opened by pressing the up arrow above the dock or swiping up anywhere on the homescreen.</p>



<p>Have a look at the preinstalled apps. There&#x2019;s no bloatware in this phone, unlike the Redmi Note 3, which not only came with the unnecessary Xiaomi apps which bombard notifications (that too uninstallable) but also with apps from other developers (eg. Facebook, Twitter, Swiftkey keyboard etc.).</p>

<p>Once you lock your phone, the lock screen would be visible. Again, it is the standard stock Android lock screen, the time and date at the centre, with the camera shortcut on the bottom-right and the voice-assist shortcut at the bottom left corner. Then there&#x2019;s the fingerprint icon between these two, if you have enabled it, otherwise, it would be a standard lock screen.</p>



<p>Unlocking the phone when the screen is off doesn&#x2019;t take much time. The screen unlocks instantly with the fingerprint scanner, like many flagship phones.</p>



<p>Now given that the screen size is quite huge, there might be troubles to reach the top of the screen, depending upon the position in which you are holding the phone). This is why the Nokia 7 plus provides an option of gestures. Particularly, swipe down to reveal notifications is the most helpful. Then there&#x2019;s also a double-press power button to launch the camera gesture, along with other useful gestures.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://sparker0i.me/blog/?attachment_id=529"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173408.png" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-529" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173408.png 1080w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173408-150x300.png 150w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173408-768x1536.png 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173408-512x1024.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Also there are the&#xA0;useful Google apps, like Google Photos for the gallery, Google Chrome for browsing. I wish there were two more apps pre-installed, a Calculator app and a Voice Recorder app, which would have completed the essentials suite.</p>



<h3>SYNTHETICS</h3>



<p>Nokia 7 Plus is powered by the Snapdragon 660 processor. It has 8 Kryo cores, 4 of the 2.2 GHz and the other 4 at 1.8 GHz. There&#x2019;s also Adreno 512 GPU used for powering intensive graphics tasks like gaming. Only one variant of this phone exists in India, with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage. From this 64 GB, we will get 50 GB of usable space.</p>



<p>The phone feels smooth enough for daily usage. I didn&#x2019;t see any visible lag in apps, until the July Security Update. With the July Security Update, apps like Chrome, Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp would hang occasionally for 2-5 seconds and then resume again. Same goes when typing on the keyboard, where the keys would appear frozen until 2-5 seconds later. This is still not fixed in the August security update, but with my time on the Android P final developer preview, this problem didn&#x2019;t exist. So maybe in September, with the Android P release, this would go away.</p>



<h3>GAMING AND BROWSING</h3>



<p>Gaming performance is very good &#x2013; if not great. I could play PUBG at Medium to High graphics with HD Resolution (HDR and Ultra HD aren&#x2019;t supported on this phone). The colors were set to realistic. I also regularly played Clash of Clans, Real Cricket 18, Knife Hit, Asphalt 9 as well. I did not notice any visible frame drop in these games.&#xA0;</p>



<p>Apart from all these, I could open up to 17 Chrome tabs upon, without any of them reloading due to dormancy. All in all, the Snapdragon 660 paired with 4 GB of RAM should be okay for everyone for day-to-day usage.</p>

<h3>REAR CAMERA</h3>



<p>The Nokia 7 plus has a dual camera setup on the back. The primary one is a 12 MP dual pixel sensor (1.4 micron pixel size) with a f/1.75 aperture. The secondary camera is a 13 MP telephoto lens (1.0 micron pixel size) with up to 2x optical zoom, at an aperture of f/2.6. Both the lenses have the Carl Zeiss branding, something we&#x2019;ve seen in the high-end Lumias, and the pre-Lumia Nokia smartphones.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173721.png" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-530" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173721.png 2160w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173721-300x150.png 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173721-768x384.png 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173721-1024x512.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px"><figcaption>Different modes in the camera app</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are quite a lot of modes in the camera of this phone. Photo, Video, Pro mode, Slow Motion, Live Bokeh, Panorama, Time Lapse</p>



<p>The camera app UI was good, until an update in late-August. It has different modes of the camera which have to be scrolled one-by-one by swiping left or right. We cannot scroll through all the modes at one go. This makes it difficult to find a camera mode that is situated at either end, as earlier all the modes could be accessed from the app drawer.</p>



<h4>CAMERA OPTIONS</h4>



<p>There are quite a lot of options in the camera of the Nokia 7 Plus. One of them is the Multi-Camera Mode, where you can select single, dual or PIP mode for combined shots from the front and the rear cameras. Then there&#x2019;s the beauty mode, which smoothens your skin in the photos that appear. Then there&#x2019;s the Flash toggle and the timer option.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173844.png" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-534" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173844.png 1080w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173844-150x300.png 150w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173844-768x1536.png 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/Screenshot_20180902-173844-512x1024.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></figure>



<p>With the new camera update, there are 2 more options &#x2013; Motion Photos and Google Lens, powered by Google. Motion Photos records a 2s video of what happens right before the image is taken. Then there&#x2019;s the Google Lens button which takes you to Google Lens app. In the video mode, you will now get an option to go live on Facebook or Youtube. Though I haven&#x2019;t tested Youtube live, Facebook live just didn&#x2019;t work for me. Hopefully HMD Global can fix this with an update.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/gsmarena_106.jpg" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-531" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/gsmarena_106.jpg 1200w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/gsmarena_106-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/gsmarena_106-768x384.jpg 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/gsmarena_106-1024x512.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>Camera Settings</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clicking on the hamburger button redirects you to Camera Settings (quite odd, as in the previous version it used to open up an app drawer with all the different modes, along with Settings). Here you will see certain options pertinent to the camera. There&#x2019;s also a watermark toggle here, which lets you put up a watermark on your photo/video. You can choose between three different types of watermarks, with the Nokia | Zeiss branding being the default one.</p>



<h3>QUALITY</h3>



<p>The image quality in daylight with the rear camera is quite good. Details are mostly preserved. Noise is not an issue either. Saturation is on par with other mid-range phones. Here are some of the sample shots taken using the primary back camera.</p>

<p>Talking about the telephoto lens, it is quite a good secondary camera sensor. There won&#x2019;t be visible problems with the image, unless we zoom to near the max possible limit.</p>



<p>I believe the low light camera performance could have been better. There is quite a lot of noise when photos were taken with the low light sensor.&#xA0;<br></p>

<p>The phone has a mode called Live Bokeh. Basically, it&#x2019;s just another name for portrait mode that you see in other phones. In this mode, the subject is kept in focus and the background is blurred while taking the photo, and not after taking it (though there exists a way to edit the blur amount after taking the photo). It works well on non-human subjects too.</p>



<p>Selfies taken with the phone are excellent, but in outdoors there may be high saturation, not always.&#xA0;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/IMG_20180902_174303-e1535906845921.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/IMG_20180902_174303-e1535906845921.jpg" alt="Nokia 7 Plus review: The best Android One Smartphone?" class="wp-image-542" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/IMG_20180902_174303-e1535906845921.jpg 2304w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/IMG_20180902_174303-e1535906845921-150x300.jpg 150w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/IMG_20180902_174303-e1535906845921-768x1536.jpg 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/09/IMG_20180902_174303-e1535906845921-512x1024.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 2304px) 100vw, 2304px"></a><figcaption>Selfie with Live Bokeh</figcaption></figure>



<h3>VIDEO QUALITY</h3>



<p>The Nokia 7 Plus can record 4K videos. Sadness is when you realise that this phone can record only 30 fps video at any resolution video. There&#x2019;s EIS too, but it works only with 1080p video.</p>



<p>Videos are crystal clear and sharp. They are noise-free during the daylight.&#xA0;</p>


<!-- nextpage -->



<p>This phone is quite like the Nexus series of phones, providing stock Android experience without spending too much money.&#xA0;</p>



<h3>NOKIA 7 PLUS ALTERNATIVES</h3>



<p>With this being said, there are a few alternatives in the market. One of them is the Honor View 10. It has almost similar spec sheet barring the flagship processor and the 20 MP monochrome camera. Then there&#x2019;s the upcoming Galaxy A8 Star, but it will cost you Rs. 35000, and it comes with Samsung&#x2019;s own UI skin on top. Also, nobody knows how the camera will perform on it.</p>



<h3>Mi A2 &#x2013; THE REAL CHALLENGER</h3>



<p>If there is one real challenger to the phone, it should be the Mi A2. It comes with almost the same spec sheet as this phone. The reason why I say this is a real challenger is that of its price. The Mi A2 is Rs. 9000 cheaper than the Nokia 7 Plus. Mi A2&#x2019;s base variant retails for Rs. 16999 whereas the Nokia 7 Plus retails for Rs. 25999. Yes, the price gap is huge.</p>



<p>Despite this, the Mi A2 may not be suited for all even at that price range. It misses out on a few key features, people buying a phone at that price point expect. There&#x2019;s no headphone jack, no MicroSD slot, there&#x2019;s an average battery size, and if a few reports are to be believed, the display colors also seem washed out. Now the last 3 features may not be a deal breaker at all, but the headphone jack might just be the thorn. The bundled USB-C to 3.5mm jack converter should please the Mi A2 buyers.</p>



<h3>VERDICT</h3>



<p>My final verdict would be to go for this phone only after the price drops to around Rs. 23000 as the 9000 Rupee price difference between Mi A2 and Nokia 7 Plus is just not reasonable.</p>

<h3>CUTTING THE WOOD IN FACTORY</h3>



<p>The process starts with cutting the wood logs in the factory. This factory uses the logs of the Neem tree to obtain the final product because they are of the best quality.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><a href="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_121832.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_121832-1024x768.jpg" alt="Factory Visit - Episode of a visit to a Wood Cutting Factory" class="wp-image-462" width="768" height="576" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_121832-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_121832-300x225.jpg 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_121832-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a></figure>



<p>These wood logs are first passed into a machine, from where you will get wood sheets as output. Here is a video that illustrates this better. The image below the video will show you the output of that machine.</p>

<p>The next step is to send these wood sheets to cutting, which gives us the wood sheets of required dimensions. Therefore we obtain a combination of good wood and bad wood sheets. The bad wood is sent to a burning plant in Tamilnadu to generate electricity.</p>

<p>The good wood goes on to become plywood. Here&#x2019;s the good wood.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><a href="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_115601.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_115601-1024x768.jpg" alt="Factory Visit - Episode of a visit to a Wood Cutting Factory" class="wp-image-467" width="512" height="384" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_115601-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_115601-300x225.jpg 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_115601-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a><figcaption>Good wood obtained after cutting</figcaption></figure>



<p>Similarly, there&#x2019;s also another process of cutting the bad wood into a sheet of  dimensions. The video below helps describe this better</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/VID_20171212_120231.mp4"></video></figure>



<h3><a href="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120348.jpg"></a>DRYING</h3>



<p>Once we get the sheets of good wood, these sheets dry under the sun. Usually, this finishes in around 4-5 hours, but it may vary. Here is a picture illustrating drying of good sheets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><a href="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120432.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120432-1024x768.jpg" alt="Factory Visit - Episode of a visit to a Wood Cutting Factory" class="wp-image-469" width="768" height="576" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120432-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120432-300x225.jpg 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120432-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a><figcaption>Good sheets kept for drying</figcaption></figure>



<p>Only 1 lakh sq. Km of sheets can dry at a time due to space restrictions. With a drying machine, drying wood sheets of 1 lakh + 4 lakh km sq = 5 lakh sq. km is not an issue.</p>



<p>These sheets sell in huge numbers to plywood factories, from where we obtain plywood. Each sheet will have crests and troughs. The reason is that the sheets dry under the sun. With a drying machine, this would never happen, because we get a straight sheet of wood.</p>



<h3>PLYWOOD</h3>



<p>This is a plywood made from the sheets supplied by this factory.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120510.jpg" alt="Factory Visit - Episode of a visit to a Wood Cutting Factory" class="wp-image-475" width="768" height="576" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120510.jpg 4608w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120510-300x225.jpg 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120510-768x576.jpg 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120510-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Plywood made from the wood sheets of this factory</figcaption></figure>



<p>Likewise, you can see stripes between the plywood on its lateral side. Many dried wood sheets are glued together to create this, apart from the other factory processes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120521.jpg" alt="Factory Visit - Episode of a visit to a Wood Cutting Factory" class="wp-image-474" width="768" height="576" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120521.jpg 4608w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120521-300x225.jpg 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120521-768x576.jpg 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/IMG_20171212_120521-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Lateral side of the plywood</figcaption></figure>



<h3>A PLYWOOD MACHINE PERHAPS?</h3>



<p>Ever since this factory trip took place, a drying machine was installed here. Also, there are plans on having the plywood machine as well.</p>



<p>Moreover, adding a plywood making machine alongside will give four-fold benefits:</p>



<ul><li>Good quality of dried sheets</li><li>Good quality of plywood</li><li>Increased employment, due to <g class="gr_ gr_122 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="122" data-gr-id="122">increasing</g>&#xA0;machinery and scalability requirements</li><li>Increased production, giving profit to owners</li></ul>



<h3>SIGNING-OFF</h3>



<p>Most importantly, I can&#x2019;t sign off before thanking those people, because of whom I could have a hands-on tour of the factory. Here&#x2019;s a pic of the factory owners (Pro tip: The one on the right is <a href="https://twitter.com/theamritanair">@theamritanair</a>&#x2018;s uncle)</p>

<p>Until another post, ciao.</p>

With previous versions of Windows, Microsoft used to release a new version of Windows once every 3 years. This changed with Windows 10, when Microsoft started releasing a new version of Windows 10 every 6 months. With this, Microsoft has rolled 5 updates to this OS, the latest being the April 2018 update.</p>
<p>Compare this to the version that rolled out initially, there would be a lot of usability improvements, more strikingly on the graphic changes. Microsoft started rolling out parts of their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/">Fluent Design System</a> since 2017, changing the way every element of Windows looks. The Windows 10 you see today is the equivalent of one of those 3-year releases, and perhaps even better because Windows users have been able to provide real-time feedback, via Feedback Hub and their forums, as new features have evolved in these three years.</p>
<h3>WINDOWS 10 USER INTERFACE</h3>
<h5>Simplification</h5>
<p>When Microsoft rolled out Windows 10 initially, there were two apps with which you could control settings inside the OS &#x2013; the more trusted Control Panel, and the newly built Settings app. At launch, Microsoft did state that they were looking to migrate many of the settings from the Control Panel to the new Settings app. So has happened.</p>
<p>The slider below shows how the control panel looks in Windows 7, the initial Windows 10, and the latest April 2018 update.</p>

<p>A lot of the options have been moved away from the control panel today. They now rest somewhere in the Settings app. The slider below shows how the Settings app looks in the latest update, compared to the one that initially rolled out. Several new options have been added, UI and the user experience has been improved. More importantly, many features that were previously available only in Control Panel, are now exclusive in Settings, thereby starting the process of deprecating the Control Panel.</p>

<h5>User Design</h5>
<p>Windows 10 apps had only a Light background to start with, which was not White, rather a Dull Grey. This changed in 2016, when Microsoft added a Dark Mode for Windows apps. Now the colors are either Pure white or Dark black, a welcome move.</p>
<p>The start menu has also undergone changes. In the initial release, there was a most used apps section and an all apps button below it, and the pinned tiles on the right. Microsoft merged Most apps and all apps in 2016, so that the left side now shows them together. It also added a hamburger menu, where our user account and power menu reside. On a full screen start, it also shows an option to switch between Pinned tiles and all apps. And the more glaring bugs like the one that allowed start to only <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/29/windows_10_bug_alert_start_menu_breaks_512_entries/">show 512 apps in all apps</a> has also been fixed.</p>

<p>Overall Score: 8/10. I will give the UX an 8 because I feel that the Fluent Design elements are not yet fully implemented throughout the OS. They are scattered throughout. If anything in those <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/taking-a-closer-look-at-microsofts-fluent-design-system/">concept pictures </a>turn out to be true, I will think of this score again.</p>
<h3>UPGRADES AND UPDATES</h3>
<p>One advantage Windows 10 came with is that we don&#x2019;t have to download a lot of security updates and maintanence packs, like it used to be in Windows 7 and 8.x, just one cumulative file is enough to rule them all.</p>
<p>Along with this came another certain disadvantage, 2 OS upgrades every year, unlike Android and iOS which come with 1 OS upgrade and a maintanence upgrade soon after. This can be a let-down for those who are on a tight internet budget.</p>
<p>But there is some relief for those who worry about the data. Firstly, some clever engineering has allowed Microsoft to shrink the update size slightly, by around 35%, which means that an upgrade that would previously download 4.4 GB would now download only 2.86 GB, which by no means is small, but some reduction is better than naught. Another option Microsoft has provided is the ability to defer feature updates (upgrades) for a maximum of 365 days, and security updates for a maximum of 30 days (applicable only for Windows 10 Pro and above). This move is sensible, since quite a lot of users have reported failures in installing a feature update and this would give Microsoft the time to fix those critical bugs.</p>
<p>Overall Rating: 7/10. I would wish Microsoft pushes feature updates once a year, and a maintanence release after 2 months, as the current scenario would end up downloading around ~5.5 GB per year, just for OS upgrades.</p>
<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<p>Many security features are present in every Windows 10 edition, including support for biometric authentication in Windows Hello, pervasive disk encryption, and built-in antimalware protection. Microsoft also provides the Windows Defender Security Center, which ties its many security features into a single dashboard.</p>
<p>Enterprise users also have a feature called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/Windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection">Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. </a>This feature is designed to detect threats that have made it past other defenses and provides corporate customers with tools to investigate breaches and offer suggested responses. There are other features like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/windows-defender-exploit-guard">Windows Defender Exploit Guard</a> and Windows Defender Application Control, again only for the Enterprise</p>
<p>Overall Rating : 9/10. Excellent security. I just wish that all the features are available for regular Windows 10 consumers.</p>
<h3>APPS</h3>
<p>Lack of apps &#x2013; The weakest link in Windows 10. It is also one of the primary reasons why Windows Phone/Windows 10 Mobile shut down. Many of the popular desktop apps like&#xA0;Office, iTunes, Slack, and Spotify are now available in the store after UWP-ifying them through a bridge. Still they have done little to bring the Windows 10 app platform to life.</p>
<p>Sure, they now have some good AAA rating games on the Store, but they are still not enough in my view. Meanwhile, the apps that are included with a default installation of Windows 10 are greatly improved from the rough first-generation versions, but this is offset by the load of crapware, like Candy Crush that Microsoft bundles with every new Windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>Overall Rating: 5.5/10</p>
<h3>FORCED ADVERTISING</h3>
<p>Now, this is one area that might seem forced upon, but there is an easy way to disable them. Still, an OS spreading such advertisements throughout the system is a bad way</p>

<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/ubuntu-two-monitors-live-800px.jpg" alt="Higher resolution in Linux without adding new hardware?"><p>People with a Full HD Screen on a laptop will enjoy a large real estate, compared to those who do not have one. Those who don&#x2019;t have a higher resolution display can now have one on their systems. The only caveat is you will need a Linux machine, and you must remember the aspect ratio of your display, 16:9, 16:10, 4:3, 3:2 etc. However, a word of caution, I&#x2019;m not responsible for any damage that happens to your product due to this article. Handle with care.</p>



<h2>ADD THE REQUIRED DISPLAY RATIO</h2>



<p>My current laptop has a resolution of 1366&#xD7;768, which translates to an aspect ratio of 16:9. I wanted to convert this screen into a Full HD experience. On a 16:9 display, a FHD resolution would have meant 1920x1080px resolution.</p>



<p>To add a display mode, you will need to use the command sudo cvt 1920 1080 60 , where 1920 is my width (in px), 1080 is my height , and 60 represents a 60Hz monitor refresh rate. This means that your monitor will update once in every 1/60th second.</p>



<p>You will now get an output something similar to the one below (If you don&#x2019;t get something similar, it is because your display might not be supporting it):</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"># 1920x1080 59.96 Hz (CVT 2.07M9) hsync: 67.16 kHz; pclk: 173.00 MHz
Modeline &quot;1920x1080_60.00&quot;  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync</pre>



<p>Now, you will need to copy everything that comes after Modeline, ie. &#x201C;1920x1080_60.00&#x201D; 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync .</p>



<p>Then run the command sudo xrandr &#x2013;newmode &#x201C;1920x1080_60.00&#x201D; 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync</p>



<h2>CHECK WHETHER DISPLAY RATIO ADDED OR NOT</h2>



<p>To check whether your display ratio was added to the Linux system or not, you will need to use the command sudo xrandr -q . You will now get a list of display resolutions supported by your laptop. Your output should look like something below:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1366 x 768, maximum 8192 x 8192
eDP-1 connected primary 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 344mm x 194mm
   1366x768      60.00*+  40.00  
   1360x768      59.80    59.96  
   1280x720      60.00    59.99    59.86    59.74  
   1024x768      60.04    60.00  
   960x720       60.00  
   928x696       60.05  
   896x672       60.01  
   ...
   ... 
   360x202       59.51    59.13  
   320x180       59.84    59.32  
DP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
HDMI-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
HDMI-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
  1920x1080_60.00 (0x34e) 173.000MHz -HSync +VSync
        h: width  1920 start 2048 end 2248 total 2576 skew    0 clock  67.16KHz
        v: height 1080 start 1083 end 1088 total 1120           clock  59.96Hz
</pre>



<p><strong>Make note of the thing that appears in place of eDP-1 for you.</strong></p>



<h2>ADDING THE HIGHER RESOLUTION TO SETTINGS MENU</h2>



<p>After you have made a note of the name from the previous step, run the command sudo xrandr &#x2013;addmode eDP-1 1920x1080_60.00 , where 1920&#xD7;1080 is your resolution, 60.00 represents the refresh rate, and eDP-1 is the display where you want to add the resolution. If there are no errors, there will not be any output.</p>



<h2>CHECK UBUNTU SETTINGS FOR THE NEW DISPLAY RATIO</h2>



<p>Now open Settings -&gt; Display in your Ubuntu. In the display resolution you should now see the higher resolution, if everything went well, just like the one below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><a href="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-05-23-30-02.png"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-05-23-30-02.png" alt="Higher resolution in Linux without adding new hardware?" class="wp-image-422" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-05-23-30-02.png 854w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-05-23-30-02-300x201.png 300w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-05-23-30-02-768x513.png 768w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/wordpress/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-05-23-30-02-360x240.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px"></a></figure>



<h2>ANY SIDE EFFECTS?</h2>



<p>Well, there is one small side effect. The fonts appear slightly blurred because your display does not natively support the higher resolution. Rest assured that the text is completely readable, unlike what the scale menu and title bar option would have done.</p>



<p>Now until next time, let me enjoy my higher resolution and a large real estate.</p>
